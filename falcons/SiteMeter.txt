Thanks for creating a Site Meter for your web site. You'll need 
to save this message because it contains the codename and password 
for your account. You'll need them when you want to login to your 
account on Site Meter.

Your codename is   s14axafalcons
Your password is   GILILE

There are two versions of the Site Meter HTML available for your 
site. One uses JavaScript and the other doesn't. The javascript 
Site Meter can be more difficult to add to a page (when using 
some HTML editors), but it allows you to track the original URL 
from which your visitors came before linking to your site
and also lets you see your visitor's time zone. Because many 
email servers will filter out emails that contain javascript,
it was not included in this email.  

This is the regular version of the Site Meter HTML.

The instructions for installing your Site Meter counter and the 
javascript version of the HTML are available from the manager 
page of your account. You can get to the manager page by logging
into your account at http://www.sitemeter.com and selecting MANAGER
at the top of the page. From the manager, you can also make changes
to your Site Meter account (like updating your email address, your 
site's url, or the style of your counter).

If you have any questions about Site Meter please first check the

If you don't find your answer or have any ideas on how
