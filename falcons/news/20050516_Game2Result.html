<p>The Falcons defeated company rival Battle AXA (formerly AXAdents) by a score of 10-6 last Friday evening.  The Falcons led 3-1 after 3 innings, but then Battle AXA then drew within 1, scoring an unearned run in the 4th Inning. The Falcons then decided that this game was too close for comfort, and thus responded with 7 unanswered runs (4 in the 5th inning, and 3 in the 6th).  This offensive outburst came in very handy, as the Falcons had some defensive mishaps in the 7th Inning, actually allowing Battle AXA to score 4 runs and draw within 10-6.  Battle AXA then sent the tying run to the plate, in the form of a gargantuan cleanup hitter, who would make big Mike "Winfield" Coen look like a midget (no offense to any midgets, Follo)  In the end however, Falcon ace Bob K ended up getting the better of Battle AXA (and the giant), forcing him to fly out to end the game...</p>



<p>It wasn't pretty, but the Falcons managed to finish on top, and move to 2 wins and 0 losses on the young season...Next up, the formidable Lookouts, whom the Falcons defeated 1-0 in great defensive/pitching duel last season...That game will be this coming Friday, May 20th...

</p>

<p>Game Highlights: Bob K pitched very well, scattering 6 hits, with 1 walk and 2 Ks, while allowing no earned runs...Scott Miller contributed with a solid defensive effort, making a diving stab on a ground ball up the middle, followed by an "Euerle-Bird" special on the throw to Rupe...Eric Sandurs and Keith Stanick were also solid in the field, Keith being the more solid of the two, as he refrained from knocking the ball out of his own teammate's glove...Batting heroes included Adam Bloom (2-2, RBI, 1 new pair of new shoes, they're working), Bob Rupe (1-3, RBI, could of used a ladder, 10 ft long arm, and a fishing net to help out Dan at 1B), 'ol Reliable Vernon Chin (2-3, solid as always), RJ Filipski (1-3, 2 Runs, 1 sweet tag up play from first base on a pop-up to short), Mike Casserly (2-3, 2B, 3B, 2 Runs, 3 RBI, 2 well-hidden errors, thanks Dan), Bob Kostulias (1-3, 2 RBI, 17 cigarettes smoked in the 7th Inning, thanks Dan), rookie Chris Schwab (1-3, Run, 1 1/2 mile walk from Great Lawn 81st Street, I've missed those rookie mistakes), Justin Picciano (1-2, Run, nice head first slide into home, I would have called him safe) and last but not least Dan Euerle, who made up for his 6 errors (yes 6 no joke, although I'm laughing..."Stop Bugging Out Dan, it's only a Pop-up!!!")...Dan had a monster day at the plate (2-2, 3B, HR, 3 Runs, 3 RBI, BB)...Dan single-handedly sparked the Falcons 5th Inning rally, waking up the entire team with his leadoff blast to the opposite field...Dan, then bored with an 8-run lead in the 7th Inning, decided he wanted to play for Battle AXA...that's cool, we'll see if he's welcome back next game...Larry may need to have another Friday night dinner party, and take Dan along!</p>



<p>That's all for now...on a serious note, let's all keep fellow Falcon Pat Casserly in our prayers as his final eye surgery is scheduled for this coming Wednesday, both he and I appreciate the Falcons' support!</p>



<p>And one last note, we're looking to have a team get-together after this Friday's game, to present Bob Rupe with his 2003 MVP trophy and to announce the 2004 Team MVP. The tentative location will be the Kinsale Tavern on 94th Street and 3rd Ave...I hope everyone can make it...</p>



<p>Sincerely, Coach Mike (Larry for a day)</p>
