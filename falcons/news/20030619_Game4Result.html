<p>June 19, 2003 -- The Falcons defeated the Sax Fifth Avenue High Rollers by a score of 6-4 last Tuesday evening.  The Falcons trailed 1-0 after one inning, then responded with 6 runs (3 in the 4th inning, and 3 in the 5th).  The High Rollers, a strong team that finished 2nd behind the Moonlight Grahams in our division last season, fought back with a run in the 5th inning and 2 in the bottom of the 7th.  The High Rollers actually sent the tying run to the plate in the last inning, however, the defending champion Falcons held down the fort, and came away with their 3rd win in 4 tries this season.</p>
<p>Game Highlights: Rookie 2B Alberto Hernandez was 2-4 with 2 RBI, a Triple and a Run Scored.  RF Aaron Schied, another newcomer, was 1-3 with an RBI and a Run Scored.  1B Bob Rupe was 3-3 with a Run Scored.  Catcher RJ Filipski, yet another rookie, played a hard-nosed game behind the plate and on the bases, while going 1-3 with a Run Scored.  Rookie DH Scott Miller, LF Patrick Casserly, and Pitcher Bob Kostulias were each 2-3 at the plate.  Bob K also pitched a gutsy game, getting out of several tough situations, especially in the later innings.</p>
<p>Overall, a solid performance by the now 3-1 Falcons.  Up next will be Max Capital on Friday June 27th, a rematch of last year's Championship Game.</p>
