<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons and their opponents Hit Squad played a game last night at Diamond 6- Great Lawn that won't be forgotten any time soon by either team what with a total of 44 runs scored between them and it all made for an interesting evening, sort of like eating a bad meal and then getting a bad case of food poisoning that can leave a person sick for weeks.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The game started strong for the Falcons and ended the same way. Team Falcon drew first blood scoring 7 runs in the first inning highlighted by Bob Rupe's 2 run triple and Justin Wienderhold's 3 run triple. Four more runs were scored by the Falcons in the second inning which included a Keith Stanick single that drove in 2. Meanwhile the Hit Squad were scoring runs of their own picking up 4 in the bottom of the second plus single runs in the 3rd and 4th innings and lest not forget the 5th inning when they picked up 2 more.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So now the score is 13-8 after 5 and with twilight beginning to descend, the Falcons looked for some insurance runs and got them in the 6th inning as the first 3 batters Keith, Vernon and Shaun Follo worked walks, Chris Schwab followed with a 2 run single, Justin Wienderhold lined a single to right for a run and Dan Eurele and Mike Casserly then got credited with an RBI each on fielder's choices to make it 18-8.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So you might think that the game would be in the bag but not so as Hit Squad picked up 7 runs in the bottom of the inning which included a grand slam homerun by the no.10 hitter. At this point with darkness descending the game should have been stopped but wasn't, so the Falcons plated 5 more runs on the strength of 7 singles. Now its 23-15 but the Hit Squad had last licks and in almost total darkness scored 6 more runs on a combination of seeing hits and 3 walks by a tiring Keith Stanick before finally a popup to third base to end the game giving the Falcons the club's first win of the season.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--This exhausting game had everyone in the lineup reaching base-some of the hitting stars included Adam Bloom with 3 walks, 2 hits, 3 runs scored, 3 hits from Pat Casserly, Bob Rupe (triple, double, single and 2 ribbies), Shaun Follo and his 3 hits and 3 runs scored, Chris Schwab's 3 runs and 3 ribbies and Justin Wienderhold the biggest contributor with 6 runs batted in...The defense wasn't bad with just 3 errors and there were a couple of outstanding catches by Adam Bloom and Pat Casserly in left center and left field respectively- but the pitching now there's a story as a tired Keith Stanick said later as he staggered onto the B train: "Those damn seeing eye hits, the darkness- I couldn't see the catcher" and then promptly fell asleep as the B reached 59th St....Standing in the outfield watching the action was the Mysterious Managing General Partner- disguised as a mounted policeman and wearing an eye patch, the MGP was approached by the Parks Dept.'s Director of Security Sam Diamond who asked "who are you" to which the reply came: "you can call me Rooster and the Falcons have True Grit!"...Next game is on May 14th at 7-location is Diamond 1- North Meadow so show up already!</p>
