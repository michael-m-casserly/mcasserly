<div id="FalconsNestContent">

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons opened their 30th season (28 playing) with a loss to a strong hitting Balco club by the score of 14-8 last night at chilly, damp Diamond 6 Great Lawn.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">After a score first inning, the Falcons drew first blood scoring 2 in the top of the 2nd inning on a leadoff single by Keith Stanick and after newcomer Matt Hola reached on a  throwing error, Keith scored on a single by another first timer, Justin Wienderhold and Matt scored on single by a returning R.J. Weaver's single.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So the score is 2-0 Falcons but Balco picked up a quick 4 runs in the bottom of the inning, the key hit a grand slam homerun by the no.8 hitter. After the Falcons closed to 4-3 in the next inning on Keith's RBI single, Balco then picked up 3 more runs in the bottom of the inning and were never headed after that despite outbursts by the Falcons scoring 2 in the 4th and 3 more in the 5th the highlight being a Matt Hola triple that drove in 2. Meanwhile Balco scored 3 in the 4th and 4 big runs in the 5th to build to that final score of 14-8 with the game ending early after the top of the 6th because of darkness and incoming rain.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--Team Falcon managed 12 hits to score the 8 runs, hitting heroes included Keith Stanick (3 hits, ribbie), Matt Hola(triple, 2 ribbies), Justin Wienderhold with 2 hits, 2 ribbies, R. J. Weaver's 2 ribbies and our bud Vernon Chin chipping in with an RBI single in the 5th... The hitting was more than offset by the inconsistent fielding (4 errors) and pitching (4 walks and too many flat pitches) - pitcher Keith shaking his hair of the rain and spraying people on the subway platform promised a better performance in his next start as soon as he dries out-"that's what I get for not bringing an umbrella or at least my yellow rain slicker"... As noted above the Falcons have begun year no. 30- for those who don't know, Ken Simeone started the team on March 15th, 1978- I know because I was there...The Mysterious Managing General Partner showed up with his youngest son Mel- both dressed completely in black including shades slinked behind some trees and made some pithy comments about the team's performance and when asked by the umpire "who are you supposed to be", the MGP replied: "just call us The Men In Black"...The loss was taken hard by the team with Dan Euerle vowing to wear his 8 year old shirt even if he gets a new one, a cool Manager Casserly showing off his new driver's cap, Chris Schwab heading to a 30th St. watering hole to drown his sorrows in a few brews and Adam Bloom unable to attend and text messaging his personal battle cry-"I'm in!"...Next game is on May 8th on the Great Lawn at 7:00 against Hit Squad- so be there which may also mark the return of William Mills.</p>
