<p class="FalconsNestText">Talk of getting dumped on- The X-Men, possibly the best team in the league, at least according to chief umpire James, showed how that might be true by dominating a listless Team Falcon, winning easily 8-2 in a game played at Diamond 6- North Meadow on June 20th.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The X-Men opened the scoring in the top of the first tallying 3 which involved 2 errors and a couple of singles resulting in 3 unearned runs. The X-Men then picked up a run in the third when the nos. 3 and 4 hitters reached on singles and after there were 2 outs, the no. 7 hitter singled to left center that scored the lead runner after a poor throw was made from the outfield to make the score 4-0.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The boys in the x shirts weren't through scoring, picking up more in the 4th based on a walk, some singles and a sac fly and now the Falcons are looking at a 7-0 deficit. It should be noted that throughout the game, the Falcons loaded the bases 3 different times but couldn't, at least in 2 of those situations, score any runs except in the 5th when they picked up their 2 runs: a one out walk to Shaun Follo, followed by 3 consecutive singles from Justin Wiederhold, Chris Schwab and Dan Euerle but the Falcons couldn't do any more damage as Mike Casserly forced Dan and Vernon Chin struck out to end the threat. The X-Men had picked up 1 more run in the their half of the 5th on the strength of 4 consecutive singles and so the eventual score became 8-2 X-Men.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The loss, the Falcons' 4th in 6 games played, has put the team in a tough situation to qualify for a playoff spot- with an 11 game schedule, the Falcons will probably have to win a minimum 4 and even better 5 which is what's left of the schedule in order to make the playoffs...The hitting wasn't much as the Falcons could only manage 7 hits with no Falcon getting more than 1 hit with Shaun Follo and Justin Wiederhold scoring the Falcons' 2 runs on singles by Chris Schwab and Dan Eurele...Bob(Joba)Rupe deserved a better result with 4 of the X-Men's runs were unearned but that's show biz...Adam Bloom continues his role as co-host of the PBS series Globe Trekker. This time Adam heads for Mexico City to film an episode: aside to Adam- don't drink the water and don't go out at night- stay in your room where you hope its safe...Aside to Chris Schwab here's some advice from the Mysterious Managing General Partner- disguised as the Love Guru the MGP says this about your girl problems: "set up a dance contest between your ex girlfriend and your current flameout- whoever does the tango best with you wins your heart- but if you yourself needs a tango dance lesson, I'll set up some lessons with our resident tango expert Greg Rivera"...Last night's game had some key Falcons missing- our next game is on June  27th in the North Meadow- we need everyone down to help the team- in short we need a W to stay in the playoff hunt- so everybody who matters to this team come on down already!</p>
