<p class="FalconsNestText">Faced with losing their 4th game in 5 played, The Falcons behind the timely hitting of Tim Flynn, Bob Rupe, Keith Stanick and Greg Rivera plus the stellar pitching performance of Bob (Joba) Rupe, downed Smith Barney 5-1 at beautiful Diamond 1, North Meadow on June 2nd.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">"God did we need this W" shouted a cheery acting manager Dan Eurele after the game. As he changed back to his street clothes at his inflatable locker, Dan on a roll, continued: "if we had lost tonight, it might have killed our chances for a playoff spot- but with the win, we've got a shot!"</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"> The game itself had the Falcons draw first blood in the bottom of the first as Tim Flynn drilled a single to center and Keith Stanick and Greg Rivera followed with 2 out singles for the run. The Falcons made it 2 zip in the third as that man Mr. Flynn lead off with an infield single, advanced on a throwing error and scored on Bob Rupe's single to left.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So now it's the 5th inning and it was time for 'insurance runs time' and Team Falcon delivered the goods as Tim Flynn came up with his 3rd straight hit and there followed 4 consecutive singles by Greg, Vernon, Justin Wienderhold and Shaun Follo that eventually scored Tim and Greg. Smith Barney picked up their lone run in the 6th on a leadoff walk, a single and a sac fly. Now the Falcons felt 'threatened' and managed an insurance run in the 6th when that man again Tim Flynn after having reached on a force play, eventually scored on the strength on Keith Stanick's RBI single. Smith Barney then went down 1-2-3 in the 7th and the Falcons had their all important 2nd win of the season.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--Lets look at the hitting; Tim Flynn was hands the hitting star (3 hits, 4 scored) plus Bob Rupe (2 hits, ribbie), 3 hits from Greg Rivera and 2 hits and a ribbie from Shaun Follo...The pitching- looks like the new pitching star has been born as Joba Rupe turned in a tremendous performance, scattering just 5 hits and one walk that led to the lone Smith Barney run- after the game, Bob Rupe denied he was Joba- "that's not me, he's really my look a like cousin" which seemed to confuse the Falcons' official co-mascots making their first appearance at a Falcons game- Rocky the Bulldog and his younger pal Chief: had this "conversation"(it's a good thing I speak bark): Rocky:" I can't tell who's who- Joba or Bob-g-r-r-r, Chief: " are you blind?- that's Joba and that other one is our beloved Rupe- snort and when I get to be as big as you, I'll be top dog": Rocky: "that will be the day dude!"...Disguised as a wino, the Mysterious Managing General Partner pretended to stagger around but always watching  was pleased by the results and when asked to identify himself said: "just call me Ratzo Rizzo"...Next game is on 6/20 at the North Meadow vs. X-Men- so be there!</p>
