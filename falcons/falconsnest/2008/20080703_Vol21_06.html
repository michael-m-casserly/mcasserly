<p class="FalconsNestText">Talk of ugly, the Falcons lost ugly to a hard hitting Jimmy Johns team in a mercy rule game 13-1 played at Diamond 6, North Meadow on July 2nd.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">How ugly was it? - try the top of the first when the JJ boys scored 8 runs off the pitching serves of the Mysterious Winfield who clearly had trouble finding his pitching groove- it resulted in a leadoff walk, a double, followed by a 2 run single, a throwing error, another walk, followed by 3 consecutive singles and a sac fly.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So now the game is 8-0 and what's a team to do when its in a hole early why you get on base any way you can and the Falcons tried that in the bottom of the first starting with leadoff walks to Adam Bloom and Pat Casserly and just like the last game against the X-Men, the Falcons loaded the bases as Keith Stanick reached on a one out infield single, but then the rally died as Winfield flied to left center and Vernon Chin hit into a force to end the inning.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">After this the Falcons behind Mike's pitching settled down allowing single runs in the 2nd and 3rd innings. So with the score 10-0, the Falcons picked up their lone run in the 4th as Bob Rupe lined a 2out double to left center and after a walk to Keith, Winfield reached on an error by the pitcher allowing Bob to score the unearned run.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Jimmy Johns guys invoked the mercy rule in the 6th inning by scoring the prerequisite 3 runs based on a single, two infield errors, a fielder's choice, a single, a walk and the dagger, a run producing single for run no. 13 to make it official.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The loss makes the Falcons' overall record 2 and 5 - its not impossible, but 4 consecutive wins makes it 6 and 5 with an outside shot at going to the playoffs depending on how many teams get in plus tie breakers, etc. ...The hitting by a listless Team Falcon wasn't much with Bob Rupe's double the only "highlight"... After a slow start, Winfield settled down pretty well but as he said afterwards: "I need to find a way to get into a groove right away- maybe if I played more- how about a pickup game against a few perps for starters"... So I'm ordering supper after the game and the Mysterious Managing General Partner rings me on my cell and burns my ears with his usual rah-rah rant- so please win the next game on  July 16th up in the North Meadow for me- I can't take the dude anymore!</p>
