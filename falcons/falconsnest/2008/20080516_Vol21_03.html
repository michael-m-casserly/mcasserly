<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons hooked up with a team called Aces Wild on Wednesday night at coolish Diamond 1 North Meadow and lost 10-7 and don't think for a minute that the game was closely contested because it wasn't.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Aces pulled out in front early picking up 3 runs in the bottom of the second, the highlight a 2 run single by the no. 10 hitter and 3 more in the third which included 2 extra base hits. Meanwhile the Falcons weren't doing anything in those first 3 innings, managing only 1 hit, a single by Dan Eurele. Then the Falcons struck back in the 4th scoring 3 to make the game 6-3: Pat Casserly and Bob Rupe walked and there followed run producing singles by Keith Stanick, Vernon Chin and making a welcome return to the Falcons lineup- Winfield.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">But the poker faced Aces weren't through scoring as they picked up a run in the 5th which actually was unearned and 3 more in the 6th, at least one of which was unearned due to some shaky outfield play. So the score stood 10-3 in the 7th and the Falcons staged a rally: Winfield singled and after a foul pop fly, Shaun Follo singled and advanced on an error by the first baseman, newcomer Alex Alvardo sac flied for a run, Dan and Mike Casserly reached base with Shaun scoring as Adam Bloom reached on an error and both Adam and Mike scored on Pat Casserly's 2 run triple. But it was too little, too late and the final score became 10-7 Aces.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The loss leaves the Falcons with a record of 1 and 2- not a great start, but its still early and some issues need to be addressed like more timely hitting, better fielding and more consistent pitching- speaking of which the game marked the return of the Mysterious Winfield who after the game lamented his slow start: "I didn't find my groove until the middle of the game- but by then the score was 6-3 them, next game I pitch it will be all about us"...Not much hitting as the Falcons managed only 9 hits, the highlights included the 2 run triple by Pat Casserly and Winfield's 2 hits with 7 different players scoring a run each ...The Mysterious Managing General Partner's eldest son John Henry ("call me Hank") watched the proceedings from a distance and bellowed, his jowly face shaking with rage- "we can and must do better, we won't stand for more losing now is the time to stand up and be counted!" and then came the reply from Dear Old Dad –"you can't handle the truth, you are above all else a doofus!"...Next game is on May 30th at 7 in the North Meadow – our opponents will be the Daddee and they'll be tough so come on down!</p>
