<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons continued their winning ways defeating Anglo Irish Bank by the score of 5-4 at humid Diamond 6 North Meadow last night.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The first 2 innings were scoreless, although the Falcons did load the bases in the top of the second but with 2 outs, Dan Euerle grounded out to end the threat. This became a commercial for things to come as Team Falcon then nicked The Bank for 2 runs in the third. With one out, Pat Casserly tripled home brother Mike who led off the inning with a single and Pat scored himself on Keith Stanick's double to right center.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons then proceeded to increase the lead to 3-0 in the fifth inning on the Url Man's leadoff triple and Dan-o then scored on a force involving Adam Bloom. It should be noted that in this particular instance, the Falcons loaded the bases after the score via two walks and a single but Bob Rupe ended the threat by hitting into a force. That 3-0 lead went to 4-0 when once again the leadoff hitter this time the Mysterious Winfield reached third on a misplayed triple and Winfield then scored on R.J. Filipski's sac fly.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Now here's where things got interesting as the Irish Bank boys started to stir the pot scoring 2 in the bottom of the sixth on the strength of 3 straight one-out singles, an error and a force. Now it's the Falcons' half of the seventh inning and someone said "we could use an insurance run" (actually it was probably me) and the team responded when Adam Bloom drilled a leadoff single to right that was misplayed into a two base error and so with Adam on third base, Pat Casserly lifted a sac fly to left to get that all important extra run. Good thing too because those pesky Bankers came almost storming back based on a lead off single, an error, a triple and a sac fly. So with the score now 5-4, the threat continued with 2 more singles, but finally the game ended in a Falcon victory when pitcher Winfield induced a fly out to left.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The win equaled the Falcons' best start since 1990, however it should be noted that the longest winning streak in Falcons' history took place in 1987 when the team won all 7 regular season games, followed by 5 straight playoff wins for a streak of 12 wins, before the Falcons lost 3 in a row to lose the 1987 Championship series to archrival The Skull...The Falcons' 14 hits and 5 runs were scattered throughout the lineup producing some clutch hitting like Greg Rivera's 2 for 3 and a ribbie, Keith Stanick's 3 for 4 and 2 ribbies, a triple and a sac fly from Pat Casserly, R.J.'s sac fly and a leadoff triple and a score by Dan Eurele...Let's not forget Winfield's mostly solid pitching until he tired a bit in the last two innings, overall though the big guy pitched well...Adam Bloom returned to the lineup after his trip to Poland in his role as a co-host of Globe Trekker where he stuffed himself with Polish cusine: "Me and the Mrs. can barely move from all that food" belched Adam "but as soon as I lose 25 pounds, I'll be back to my normal slim self"...A quick note: Bullet Bob Kostulias has been elected to the Falcons Hall of Fame -- more on that later...Our next game will be on 6/29 vs. a tough Balco team -- so be there already at Diamond 1 on the Great Lawn at 7 pm!</p>
