<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons came into last night's game against the High Rollers as a team with its back to the wall: lose and the record is a win and 4 losses and maybe playing out the string, win the game for a reversal of fortune and getting back in the race for a playoff spot and so the pressure was on not only for the team but also for the newly appointed acting manager Dan Euerle subbing for the injured Mike Casserly on the shelf with a broken ankle (more on that later). So the scene was set at Diamond 6, North Meadow and the Falcons playing with a revised lineup and defensive alignment defeated a tough High Rollers club in a thrilling 3-2 victory as Dan Euerle went yard in the bottom of the 8th to grab the win.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The tone of this contest was set right away in the top of the first when the Rollers placed two runners on base via one-out singles but the cleanup hitter hit into a 5-4 double play that featured solid glove work from Adam Bloom, back playing at 2nd base in the Falcons' revised lineup.  The Falcons got off to the early 1-0 lead in the 2nd inning that featured hits from Greg Rivera, eventually erased on a fielder's choice and R.J. Filipski with Vernon Chin walking in between the hits and ultimately scoring on Scott Miller's sac fly to left.  The High Rollers then tied the score at 1 that saw an unusual force by Adam Bloom alertly throwing to 3rd base to nail the sliding runner on a close play.  The Falcons moved ahead in their half of the 3rd picking up a run on hits from Dan Euerle and Mike Coen who scored after 2 consecutive errors on the Roller infield.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Rollers then tied the game picking up a run in the 6th scoring the eventual unearned run on a leadoff error and 3 singles loading the bases, but Winfield in his first start as the Falcons' pitcher induced fly balls for the last 2 outs to end the threat with minimal damage.  After this, nothing much happened until the bottom of the 8th: after Scott Miller bounced out to short and Eric Sandurs struck out, Dan Euerle delivered the dramatic opposite field dinger over the right fielder's head for the big win and give the Falcons the 2 and 3 record.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons' Front Office announced yesterday that Manager Mike Casserly had broken his ankle playing hockey and has been placed on the 60 day DL.  Mike's story is that his skate got caught in a hole in the ice but here's the real story: Mike encountered the Mysterious Managing Partner pretending to be a maintenance worker and while operating a Zamboni, started berating Mike about the team's slow start, lost control of the machine and "checked" the startled mgr into the boards and then ran over his foot -- nice going Mr. MGP!...Mike's injury necessitated a change in the defensive setup with Pat Casserly shifting to left, Keith Stanick playing in right, Adam Bloom moving from left to 2nd base, Scott Miller playing at short in place of Mike and Mr. Winfield making his debut as the pitcher and it worked pretty well with the added realignment of the outfield with the outfielders shifted more to the right.  This resulted in some nice catches and relay throws with Pat Casserly's catch in the 6th a standout plus his throw from left to catcher R.J. Filipski who held on to tag out the runner to save a run...The hitting produced 9 hits with Mike Coen's 2 hits, run scored and of course Dan Eurele's big homer the hitting highlights...Our next game is a big one against the Moonlight Grahams to be played on 6/7 at Diamond 1, North Meadow 7:00pm so everyone come on down!</p>
