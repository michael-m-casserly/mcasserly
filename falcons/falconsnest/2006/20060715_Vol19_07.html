<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons continued their winning ways by defeating High Rollers 8-4 last night at Diamond 1, Great Lawn.  The win was the Falcons' 4th straight giving the team a 5 and 3 won/loss record further enhancing the Falcons' chances of securing a playoff spot.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Big Softball Team opened the scoring in the bottom of the second inning as Keith Stanick and Vernon Chin lead off with singles, Greg Rivera walked and after a pop out to 2nd base, Pete Coen and Chris Schwab singled for 2 runs, Eric Sandurs reached on a fielder's choice forcing Greg at the plate and Shaun Follo ripped a single to left, advancing to second on a poor throw that allowed both Pete and Chris to score for the 4-0 lead.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The High Rollers then answered right back in the top of the third with 3 runs of their own on the strength of 2 singles, a walk and a bases clearing 2 out triple by the no. 3 hitter.  So now the Rollers have closed to 4-3 and some one on the bench and I believe it was a young lady wearing oversized yet fashionable sunglasses who shouted out: "Let's score more runs!" and the Falcons responded in the third -- with 2 outs, Bob Rupe, Keith Stanick and Vernon Chin singled, the latter's hit scoring both Bob and Keith as Vernon moved to second on a throwing error.  Greg Rivera then walked for the second time and he and Vernon both scored as the Winfield Brothers came through with consecutive singles to make the score 8-3.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Rollers managed one more run in the top of the fourth based on a leadoff walk and a single with the runner moving to second base on a throwing error allowing the lead runner to score.  So now its 8-4 and both teams decided to take the rest of the night off and that score of 8-4 became final.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--Did I just say that both teams took the night off after scoring early? -- well after the 4th inning, the High Rollers managed 3 hits and the Falcons after the 4 run 3rd inning, managed just 1 hit.  This was partly due to some stellar pitching, including the Mysterious Winfield who other than the hiccup in the third was pretty much on cruise control...Speaking of cruise control, more celebs showed up to watch the Falcons in action in the form of power couples TomKat and Bradgelina who while admiring themselves, began admiring each other's babes -- in fact the Tom part began jumping up and down on the Falcon bench shouting: "I love Angie's lips!"...Mike Casserly, slowly recovering from the broken ankle, made a dramatic appearance sans crutches, instead used a cane and a special boot to keep his foot stable.  Mike figured that the mere sight of him would invoke sympathy and spur the team -- the old "win for the Gipper" ploy, but it didn't work as all he got was a few "how are ya's and yo bro's" -- the real spur came from Keith Stanick who kept rubbing his leg on the bench complaining about his hammy, even refusing treatment from the Falcons' 92-year-old trainer Jack Lalanne -- it invoked much empathy with Bob Rupe shouting: "Let's win this thing for the Big Bopper!"...Paid attendance was 17 -- high because of a giveaway -- an Eric Sandurs Bobble-Head doll...By the way hitting heroes included Keith Stanick (2 hits, 2 runs scored), Vernon Chin (2 hits, 2 runs scored, ribbie), Pete Coen (2 hits, run scored), Chris Schwab (run scored, ribbie single), and a Shaun Follo RBI single (that's Follo, not Fallo)...Next game is on 7/19 against Cobra Kai in the North Meadow -- Diamond 1 at 7:00pm and the next game after that is on 7/24 at 7:00 PM same place against the NY Knights-so be there!</p>
