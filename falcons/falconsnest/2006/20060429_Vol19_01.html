<div id="FalconsNestContent">

<p class="FalconsNestText">Everything looked good for the start of the Falcons' 28th season (26 actually playing), the bunting was up in full display, American Idol loser Kellie Pickler, accompanied by the West Point Army Band sang the National Anthem country and western style and former VP Al Gore in full Alpha Male mode (he wore cowboy boots and a 20 gallon Stetson!) threw out the first ball and so the stage seemed set for a big night as the Falcons jumped off to the early lead scoring 4 runs in the top of the first. Unfortunately, things went down hill from there with Balco slugging out an eventual 15-9 win at chilly breezy Diamond 1, Great Lawn last night.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Those 4 runs were scored on a leadoff walk to Adam Bloom, a returning Pat Casserly singled, veteran Bob Rupe doubled home Adam and cousin Keith Stanick sac flied home Pat. There followed a Vernon Chin RBI single scoring Bob, Scott Miller and R.J. Filipski singled sending Scott to third who then scored on a sac fly hit by the remarkable Shaun Follo.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"> But Balco wasn't to be denied scoring 3 runs in their half of the inning which included a leadoff homerun to close to 4-3 and powered ahead to 7-4 in the 3rd inning on the basis of 4 singles and a sac fly. The Falcons made the score 7-6 as Eric Sandurs drilled a homer to left, Dan Euerle reached on an infield hit and when Balco started to throw the ball around after Mike Casserly grounded to the pitcher, Dan alertly scored for the second run of the run of the inning.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">This however didn't deter the heavy hitting Balco club who followed with 4 runs of their own in the bottom of the inning which featured back to back homeruns. With the score 11-6, the Falcons answered back with 3 runs on the strength of a 3 run homerun bomb from Bob Rupe in the 5th, but that was all she wrote for the Falcons' scoring as Team Falcon watched Balco score twice more in the bottom of the 5th and 2 more in the 6th for the final score of 15-9. So the Falcons start off with a loss, but there are 11 games to play yet and the team should bounce quickly starting with the next game May 3rd vs. Battle AXA at Diamond 5, North Meadow at 7:00 P.M.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons' General Manager had quite an experience later after the game -- let him tell it: "I'm eating dinner at my favorite Bayonne diner, consisting of a cup of Manhattan Clam, hot open turkey on whole wheat bread with mashed and peas and hungrily chowing it down when a cell phone at a nearby table rings to the sound of the team song 'We Are the Falcons' and who is it? -- none other than the Mysterious Managing General Partner ranting and raving about the loss. After I'm handed the phone, my ear is chewed out: 'What's with the loss – What's with those bleeping homeruns and throwing to the wrong cutoff man', and on and on Ad Nausem and he terminated the call stating 'by the way try the brown gravy with that turkey Dude' and hung up- "You heard the man watch those fundamentals"...The hitting was quite good with Bob Rupe leading the way with a homer and 4 RBIs and a bases empty dinger from Eric Sandurs...now remember we play next on 5/3 and the next game after that will be played on 5/8 -- so you'all be there!</p>
