<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons played mongoose to Cobra Kai's cobra and hung a loss on the previously undefeated CK boys to the tune of 7-5 played at a breezy Diamond 6 North Meadow.  The game also marked the return of Bullet Bob Kostulias to the softball war, at least for one night.  "It's my new job as a limo driver" as he removed his standard issue turban he continued: "my responsibilities ferrying mysterious <i>businessmen</i> wearing silk suits and sporting a bulge under their jackets is both enormous and time consuming, but whenever I'm able, I'm more than happy to come down and help the Cardinal Red and Gold to fulfill the team's mission which is to win a championship" -- makes one emotional doesn't it?</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So the stage was set for what turned out to be one of the Falcons' better games as the Cobra opened the scoring picking up a run in the first inning on a run producing double by the no. 3 hitter.  The Falcons answered back immediately as Adam Bloom led off the bottom of the first with a double and eventually scored on Keith Stanick's double.  The Falcons moved ahead 3-1 as both Dan Euerle and Adam Bloom scored after hits from Bob Kostulias and Pat Casserly's double all this happening in the third inning.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Cobra then rallied to take the lead 5-3 picking up 4 runs in the top of the 4th on the basis of a leadoff single and 4 consecutive 1-out hits.  The Falcons however were not to be deterred, rallying for 3 of their own in the bottom of the inning as Keith Stanick reached on an infield error and with one out, Scott Miller reached and advanced on an infield hit on a throwing error by the shortstop, Chris Schwab drove in a run with a hard single to right and Greg Rivera drove in a pair with his usual double.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Now the idea is to hold the Kai down and first and foremost to pickup at least one insurance run which happened in the 5th inning.  Adam Bloom reached on an infield hit, Pat Casserly singled to left but got overly ambitious trying for the extra base and got caught in a rundown between second and third but not before Adam touched up to make things 7-5.  Meanwhile the Bullet settled down and shut down CK from the 5th inning on for the all important victory, the Falcons' 6th of the year and 5th straight win.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons' hitting was mostly timely as the team produced 14 hits which included 3 hits, 3 runs scored, 1 ribbie from Adam Bloom, a run producing double from Pat Casserly, 2 hits, a run scored and solid defensive play as the catcher from Scott Miller, a couple of hits and a ribbie by Chris Schwab, Greg Rivera delivering a double that scored 2 and Bob Kostulias managed an opposite field hit and got it done on the mound with a clutch pitching performance to shut the Cobra down when he needed to...Speaking of  clutch players, the Falcons announced the team's MVP for the 2005 regular season and the winner is of course the veteran Dan Euerle who had his best year in '05 -- Dan didn't say much as he received his trophy, but later was spied crying uncontrollably in a vehicle parked on 5th Av...Bullet Bob had an interesting experience going home -- absentmindedly putting back on his turban, got hailed for a ride and out of force of habit  picked up the ride- let Bob tell it: "I wasn't watching what the guy looked like, but once in the car and in a voice that sounded like a combination of Jay Leno and Tom Cruise on HGH shouted out: 'GREAT JOB PITCHING AND WINNING THE GAME, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK OR ELSE!’ -- and suddenly I knew that it was the Mysterious Managing General Partner who immediately jumped out to a waiting Hummer and took off for parts unknown"...the next game is on July 24th in the North Meadow at Diamond 1 with game time at 7 so be there!</p>
