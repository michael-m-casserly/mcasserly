<p class="FalconsNestText">Team Falcon came to this game against a winless Battle AXA team with the idea of a possible easy win, but on a cloudy, muggy night at Diamond 1 North Meadow found instead a pesky, feisty Battle AXA club living up to its name giving the Falcons a real game until the Cardinal and Gold broke a 5-5 tie scoring 6 runs in the 6th inning to take the big lead and eventually the victory.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons drew first blood scoring 2 in the top of the first on a 1-out double by Pat Casserly who scored on a throwing error.  Bob Rupe then followed with a single to left and Keith Stanick boomed a triple to the same spot scoring Bob.  Meanwhile Battle AXA started to peck away, scoring a run in the bottom of the first on 3 singles and after the Falcons had picked up a run in the bottom of the third keyed by a walk to Adam Bloom who eventually plated run no.3 on a Vernon Chin single, the Battle then closed to 3-2 in the bottom of the inning, but the Falcons kept trucking scoring 2 in the fourth with Greg Rivera, Shaun Fallo/Follo and Dan Euerle figuring in the scoring.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The upshot is that Battle AXA kept coming, kept trying and it resulted in tying the game in the 5th inning on the basis of two one out singles, a sac fly, a triple for a run and run no. 3 coming in on a single.  So now what's a team to do when the game is tied at 5 and it's the 6th inning and there's a threat of rain and pretty soon it will be getting dark and you're the Falcons needing a W to stay in the playoff hunt, why you go out and score 6 runs to take the big 11-5 lead!  The featured hits included a run producing double by the Fallo/Follo Man, a big 3-run homer by Dan Euerle and a triple by Pat Casserly that produced run no. 6 with all runs scoring after two were out.  Now that 6 runs had scored, the Falcons went for the encore picking up 4 more runs in the 7th all with 2 outs.  The scoring featured 3 doubles by Rivera, Sandurs and a 2-run double by Shaun along with a single by Pete Winfield and a ribbie single by Acting Manager Dan.  Battle AXA managed a run in the bottom of the 7th and the final score became 15-6 for the Falcons' fourth win of the year and for the first time this season, a winning record of 4 wins and 3 losses.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--Eventually the Falcons got their hitting shoes on garnering 19 hits to generate the 15 runs with 12 of the hits and 9 of the runs scored in the final 2 innings.  Hitting heroes were abundant throughout the lineup like 2 runs scored by 4 players (Bloom, Casserly , Rivera and Sandurs), 3 runs scored, 3 hits including 2 doubles from Shaun Fallo/Follo and the 3-run homerun by Dan Euerle...The Mysterious Winfield continued his fine pitching albeit not quite as sharp as he was in his previous outing which he attributed to "packing heat" while on the mound -- "I've got to remember to put the heat in the old duffle bag the next time I pitch" said Winfield quietly...So lets vote: is it Fallo or Follo -- check off your choice: (a) Fallo or (b) Follo, so that Shaun can have a proper name he can be proud of...The Falcons' General Manager had an unnerving experience after the game -- as he hurried to catch the PATH train at 32nd Street, he was greeted over the PA system "by a voice that sounded like a combination of legendary Yankee public address announcer Bob Shepherd and Clint Eastwood on steroids" -- yes it was the Mysterious Managing General Partner shouting "CONGRATS ON A JOB WELL DONE -- KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK OR ELSE!" -- What a guy!...Don't forget we play next on 7/14 against the High Rollers with game time at 6.  The location is the Great Lawn Diamond 1.  So let's keep it going and keep on winning!</p>
