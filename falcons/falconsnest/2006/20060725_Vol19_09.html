<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons jousted with the New York Knights last night at Diamond 1 North Meadow and won the battle by the score of 3-2 behind the clutch hitting of Keith Stanick and new guy Tim Flynn plus another fine pitching performance from the Mysterious Winfield.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Knights opened the scoring in the top of the 2nd inning with a 2-out walk, followed by a single and a run-producing double.  The Falcons turn to score came in the bottom of the third when "rookie" Tim Flynn belted a 2-out triple to right and scored on the fumbled throw to the plate to tie things at 1.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The 4th inning ultimately proved to be the difference as the Falcons picked up 2 big runs as Bob Rupe led off with a walk, Keith Stanick tripled home Bob, Vernon Chin dumped a single to the short field but after Mike Coen grounded out, Keith looking to score got caught in a rundown involving the first baseman, the third baseman and the catcher getting tagged out but in the process of this happening, Vernon alertly advanced to third and then scored on a single by Greg	Rivera, a run that eventually became the difference in the outcome of the game.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The teams then exchanged scoreless 5th and 6th innings and in the 7th inning the Knights rallied to make it interesting as Winfield issued a one-out walk and after a strikeout, another walk was issued, the no.3 hitter in the Knights' lineup then lined a single to left scoring the lead runner.  So with the Knights on the bench cheering their team on, the next batter grounded to Keith at third for the force out to end the game and give the Falcons their 7th win of the year.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons managed just 7 hits in scoring the 3 runs, but some of those hits were clutch, like newcomer Tim Flynn's triple and aggressive base running to score on the error and the sequence that produced the 2 runs in the 4th inning featuring Keith Stanick's RBI triple and when he got caught in that rundown play, keeping it going long enough to allow Vernon Chin to alertly move to third base and eventually score on what proved to be the winning run on the base hit by Greg Rivera.  So a couple of heroes: Tim, Keith, Vernon, Greg and Mike Coen for another big time pitching performance...Fielding was also quite good featuring solid glove from the keystone combination of Dan Euerle and Adam Bloom, plus Tim Flynn revealing a strong throwing arm...Did anybody notice the Knights trying to possibly distract the Falcons with some comely looking young ladies doing yoga moves and sunning themselves on nearby rocks? -- and what's with those different versions of their uniforms, some blue, some green-please! -- as Greg Rivera said later: "The Falcons will not and can not be stopped from winning by distractions!"...Dan Eurele reported on Manager Mike's wedding: “Kathryn looked lovely in her Oscar De La Renta wedding gown, Mike looked sharp in his tartan plaid tuxedo and at the reception managed with his cane and his ankle boot to do an amazing Irish step dance on his good foot!"...Now we wait for the remaining two games to be rescheduled by the league -- so watch those emails and phone calls for the Word.</p>
