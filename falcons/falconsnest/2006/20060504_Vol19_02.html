<div id="FalconsNestContent">

<p class="FalconsNestText">Playing in one of the their oddest games, odd because of the way the scoring went, the Falcons bunched all of their runs in the first two innings and then "held on" to beat back a determined Battle AXA team to score a 15-5 victory last night at cool, dampish Diamond 5 in the North Meadow.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">As is usually the case, the Falcons became the "road team" and got the ball rolling scoring 3 runs in the top of the first. After a hit by Pat Casserly and a walk to Bob Rupe, Keith Stanick belted a 3 run homerun to left for the early 3-0 lead. Now here's where things got interesting and maybe a little odd; the Falcons half of the 2nd inning ultimately became one of the team's best ever as Team Falcon scored 12 big runs! The runs were scored on the strength of 10 hits, a couple of walks and 3 Battle errors that figured in the overall scoring. Highlights included a run producing double by Chris Schwab, a 2 run double by Mike Casserly, back to back doubles by Pat Casserly and Bob Rupe, the latter driving in 2 runs and a run producing single by Chris Schwab as the Falcons batted around and when Pat Casserly popped to short to mercifully end the inning the score stood at 15-0.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The odd part was that there was no more scoring for the Falcons for the rest of the game, possibly because Battle AXA changed pitchers with the relief chucker throwing a strong game the rest of the way as the Falcons decided to rest on their laurels. This gave the Battle Boys a slim chance to come back as they picked up 3 runs in the 2nd inning featuring a 2 run double and single runs in the 5th and 6th innings. Even though Battle AXA threatened in the growing darkness and light rain of the 7th inning, the fight was really lost in those first 2 innings something that Battle AXA could not overcome despite some loose play by the Falcons and so the final score became 15-5 for the Falcons' first W of the season.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--All kinds of hitting heroes as the Falcons rapped out 16 hits. Leading batters included Keith Stanick's 3 run homer, Chris Schwab (3 hits,3 ribbies), Adam Bloom and his 2 hits, 2 ribbies plus a walk, Bob Rupe's 2 run double and a welcome return to the lineup by Greg Rivera chipping in with an RBI and a double...Defense was also stellar with Pat Casserly and Dan Eurele turning in fielding gems with Dan's play stopping a potential Battle rally...Once again, another celebrity showed up, this it was Donald Trump while admiring the play of the Falcons, revealed plans to build several 50 story high parking garages in Manhattan to "help the parking situation and put the small lots out of business so I can control everything"...Hey it's time to collect money for the 2005 MVP trophy -- $1.25 each should do it and how about considering hats especially since the AXA hats are no longer available -- we'll talk about it soon...Next game is on 5/8 -- Diamond 1 -- North Meadow at 7:00 P.M. -- so be there!</p>
