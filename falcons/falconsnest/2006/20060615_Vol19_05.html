<p class="FalconsNestText">Another night, another one of those "must-win" games that the Falcons have been faced with, this time against the club that beat up on Team Falcon in the first game of the season...Balco.  This time it was the Falcons' turn to win a one-sided contest, defeating the Balco Boys 6-0 at muggy Diamond 1 North Meadow last night.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">"I was concerned at the start of the game starting with just 9 players with one on the way" stated a jubilant Acting Manager Dan Euerle as he changed in the Falcons' inflatable locker room after the game -- "after all, a loss would have put us at 2 and 4, a very difficult spot to be in, but win and now we would be 3 and 3 and ready to make a playoff run."  And win they did with the visiting Falcons scoring two right away with Adam Bloom working his usual leadoff walk, Pat Casserly reached on a 2-base error sending Adam to third who scored on Bob Rupe's sac fly.  After Mike Coen reached on an error, Pat scored himself on Scott Miller's single.  So the score becomes 2-0 Falcons and you could have turned off your sets right there, because Winfield pitching in his second consecutive game and chucking with a high, deep arc effectively shut down Balco's potentially strong offense all the way allowing just 7 hits in the process.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Still you have to play 7 innings and Balco threatened a couple of times, the first time coming in the 5th inning. After the no. 8 hitter had fouled out to Dan Euerle, the next batter reached on an error, the no. 10 hitter then reached on a fielder's choice, the leadoff hitter lined a hard single to right, bobbled a bit by Keith Stanick but then turned it into a big play when the runner attempted to score as Keith made a strong throw to Chris Schwab at the plate to nail the runner ending the threat and the inning.  The Falcons then picked up 4 insurance runs in the 6th on 3 singles, a walk and the highlight, Bob Rupe's 2-run double and Keith Stanick's 2-run single.  After this, Balco threatened one more time in the 7th loading the bases with 2 outs but Winfield induced a fly out to right to end the inning with no damage done.  So as Dan had hoped for, the result became a 6-0 Falcon victory for that all important 3 and 3 record.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons picked up 10 hits in scoring those 6 runs with Adam Bloom's 3 walks, 2 runs scored, Bob Rupe's double, sac fly and 3 ribbies and Keith Stanick chipping in with 2 ribbies the hitting highlights...The Mysterious Winfield pitched great again and coming down to help was his brother Pete making his Falcon debut playing flawlessly at second base and contributing with 3 hits and a run scored...Speaking of debuts, its been announced that Adam Bloom and his lovely wife Kasia have been signed to host along with the other hosts, the PBS travel series Globe Trekker -- the Bloom's first stop: the town named after the Bloom family -- Bloomington, Indiana, where they will check out native son Don Mattingly's birth place and try out Donnie Baseball's gloves...The winners of last year's dance contest "Boogying with the Falcons" (see The Falcons Nest, Vol. 18, Issue 11) was announced and its Greg Rivera and his partner Jennifer Lopez performing a mean tango, which won them dinner for two at Roseland.  As Greg said later: "nobody tangos with me, I'm a security guard!"...Hey our next game is on 6/23 against the Battle AXA to be played in the North Meadow at 7 so lets all show up and keep on winning!</p>
