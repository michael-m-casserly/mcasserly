<p class="FalconsNestText">Before the start of last night's game, Falcons' manager Mike Casserly conversed with the Mysterious Managing General Partner via CB radio (Mike's CB moniker is "Conan" and the MGP is "Da Man") and the MGP reassured the Falcons' skipper that despite the slow start, everything would be OK "because every effort will be made to insure a winning team" and signed off with "and that's a big 10-4 good buddy -- over and out". So with this solid endorsement from the MGP, the Falcons confidently came into last night's game with the Evil Empire ready to do some serious stomping, but instead became the stompee losing to the Empire 12-4 at chilly, windy Diamond 1 North Meadow.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Truthfully, the game was decided in the first 2 innings as the Evil scored 2 in the top of the first, the key hit being a triple hit by the no.2 hitter and 4 more in the second which included a couple of singles, a walk and to help things along, 3 Falcon errors. This made the score 6-1 as the Falcons had picked up a run in the bottom of the first on Keith Stanick's sac fly. The Falcons then made it 6-2 in the third on walks to Pat Casserly and Bob Rupe and an RBI single by Keith Stanick.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So maybe the Falcons are thinking about closing the gap, but the Evil Boys had other ideas, scoring 2 in the 4th inning and picking up some insurance runs in the 6th inning bringing home 4 more on the strength of 3 singles, 2 walks and a 2 run double for the 12-2 score. The Falcons tried to rally in the bottom of the 7th as Dan Euerle led off with a single and Mike Casserly reached on an E-6. There followed singles by Adam Bloom and Pat Casserly, scoring Dan and Mike, but after Bob Rupe had reached on a fielder's choice, Keith Stanick flied to left and Chris Schwab fouled out to the first baseman and the final score became 12-4 Evil Empire.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Now with the loss, the Falcons overall record is 1 and 3 and a successful season is in jeopardy. The next game is May 31st at Diamond 6, North Meadow at 7:00 p.m. when the winning must begin again if Team Falcon is to find that ultimate success.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--After the game, as Manager Mike was getting set to leave, a helicopter suddenly appeared and slowly descending from the chopper was a large cone shaped object that enveloped the startled mgr -- yes, it was the Portable Cone of Silence as Mike and the Mysterious Managing General Partner had a private talk about the game: "What's with those bleeping errors, where's the clutch hitting, etc." and Mike got the message and that is to start a win streak all the way to the playoffs...The Falcons' General Manager was very glad "That it was Mike taking the brunt of the MGP's wrath, now I can eat my dinner buffet featuring roast turkey with all the fixings in peace!"...The game of 5/8 was a loss to the Gotham Empire 14-5 with Keith Stanick's 2 ribbies a highlight for the Falcons...in last night's game, the same pattern repeated with the opposition scoring early to take a big lead and the Falcons' response rather weak -- leading Falcons hitters again included Keith Stanick's 2 ribbies and RBI singles from Adam Bloom and Pat Casserly plus a couple of fielding gems from the Casserly Brothers but oh those errors! (6)...Hey let's get it going starting on 5/31 against the High Rollers -- see you at Diamond 6!</p>
