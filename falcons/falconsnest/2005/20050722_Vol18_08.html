<p class="FalconsNestText">Playing in their most important game of the year so far, the Falcons pounded out a 10-7 victory over yet another new opponent (their fourth in five games), a team called Frontline. The game was played last night at Diamond 4, North Meadow.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons, who seem to enjoy the role of the "road" team, showed that joy by opening the game scoring five runs for the early lead. Shaun Follo led off with a single to left, Scott Miller reached on the error committed by the left fielder, who muffed Scott's fly ball. Bob Rupe, Keith Stanick, Vernon Chin and Mike Coen singled and with two out, Chris Schwab, reaching on a fielder's choice, picked up the ribbie that scored Vernin for run number 5.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">With the score 5-1, Frontline had managed a run in the bottom of the first, Team Falcon picked up two more runs in the second.  Again doing what any good team does, getting the leadoff hitter on base (in this case the Bullet with a lead off the single to right). Shaun reached on an outfield error which drove the Bullet's sub-runner Mike Casserly to third, who then scored on a Scott Miller sac fly.  The third inning saw the Falcons extend the lead to 9-1 as Dan Euerle belted a two run home run scoring Chris Schwab, who had reached on a fielder's choice ahead of him.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Then Frontline started pecking away scoring two runs in the third, one of which was unearned, and two more runs, both unearned in the fourth.  So with the score 9-5 in the fifth, the Falcons picked up run number ten in the top of the fifth on Bob Rupe's hustling home run. Good thing too, because Frontline kept coming scoring two more runs in the sixth, one of which was unearned. But the Falcons shut the door on Frontline in the seventh, with a runner on because of an error, the Falcons seventh of the game, the final score became 10-7 giving the Falcons their 5th win of the year.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--Come to think of it, the runs scored by Frontline in the fourth inning may not both have been unearned since run number two scored on a sac fly.  Looks like the Falcons' official scorekeeper will have to consult with the official scorer, whoever the hell that person is, to straighten it out.  The usual hitting heroes stepped up to lead the offense...Shaun Follo scored twice; a sac fly by Scott Miller and his usual hustle as a catcher; Bob Rupe's homer and 3 ribbies;  3 hits from Vernon Chin; Mike Coen getting it done with four hits; Dan Euerle's 2-run homer, and how about that Silver Bullet with two hits.  Speaking of the latter, he brought along his wife and believe it or not his three and a half year old grandson Noah.  Both managed to dodge errant throws all night with Noah making a great back hand stab of yet another bad throw making him a candidate to play AXA softball in the year 2025!...Also on hand was Eric's Sandur's  girlfriend Stacey who while dodging errant throws herself was busy on a cell phone B-r-r-r-r-r-ing sounded the phone as she answered and started whispering excitedly into the phone about the playing on the field and who was she speaking to? Who else but the Mysterious Managing Partner calling from diamond 6 to check in on the team's play and getting a detailed scouting report from his new spy-I-I mean "Executive Assistant"-- His reaction will be recorded in the next Nest...</p>
