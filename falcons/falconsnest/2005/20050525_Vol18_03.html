<p class="FalconsNestText">It was a cold, nasty and ultimately rainy night at Diamond 1, North Meadow and the end result of last night's contest between the Falcons and Monday Properties was pretty nasty in its own right, at least for the Falcons who saw a 5-4 lead evaporate because of damaging walks and errors resulting in a come from behind victory for Monday Properties by the score of 10-9.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">"I thought we had this one wrapped up" lamented manager Mike after the game as he met the press in the cozy comfort of the Falcons portable locker room, "but I guess it wasn't meant to be" and with that Mike broke down and cried. So why the emotional outburst?  Take a look at the game and the way things went down. Monday Properties jumped off to an early 2-0 lead but the Falcons quickly moved ahead tallying 4 runs in the top of the third to grab the lead, the highlight being a Scott Miller 2-run double after the Prop team tied the game with single runs in the third and fourth innings. The Falcons had their biggest inning of the contest scoring 4 runs in the fifth to grab the 8-4 lead. The runs were scored on singles from Greg Rivera, Dan Euerle, a walk to the Silver Bullet to load the bases, followed by a ribbie single from Shaun Follo, a 2-run single by Scott Miller and a sac fly by Winfield produced the 4 runs.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So it's looking good--the Falcons are six outs from a W and then things turned sour as Monday. Monday scored five runs to take the 9-8 lead. With one out, the Bullet yielded a single and then unfortunately issued two walks to load the bases. The next batter "Tim the Prop Mgr" lined a 2-run single to right center and advanced on what I believe was an outfield bobble for an error and then scored on another outfield error. After a 5-3 groundout, the leadoff hitter smacked an RBI single and after another a single and yet another outfield error this time throwing, the inning ended on a fly out.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">But the Falcons were not finished just yet picking up the tying run in the top of the 7th with Dan Euerle reaching on an E-5 and scoring when the Bullet reached on yet another E-5. However the Monday team wasn't to be denied and in the gloom and a beginning rain, loaded the bases on three straight singles and scored the winner on a sac fky. So now the Falcons' record stands at 3 and 1 and the team gets a nine day break to lick its wounds and regain its Mojo for the games ahead. 
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--The Falcons certainly made the most of their 10 hits with two hits from Shaun Follo (ribbie), Scott Miller's two hits (double, 4 RBIs), a sac fly from the mysterious Winfield, a couple of hits from Dan Euerle plus 3 runs scored, and 2 runs scored by the Bullet's Beard… While the outfield play is currently the bane of the Falcons' existence, the infield defense remained stellar all the way around, including steady, solid glove work from Dan Euerle and the Bullet's great stab of a lined smash, the defensive highlight… The Falcons announced that Pat Casserly has been placed on the 60 day DL--out for the season with the eye situation… After the game, Bullet Bob and the Falcons GM were leaving the park and the Bullet lamenting the walks he issued cried out "I guess I shouldn't be called "The Silver Bullet"-- from now on call me "The Silver Bomb"--whatever dude…
Next Game is 6/2 @ 7PM-North Meadow vs. the Gotham Empire…
