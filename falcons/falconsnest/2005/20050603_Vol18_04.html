<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons had probably their best game so far in this still young season as they handily defeated the Gotham Empire last night at a coolish Diamond 3, North Meadow by the score of 8-1. Most importantly that W was the Falcons fourth win in the first five games of the year.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The scoring started immediately in the top of the first as Shaun Follo and Bob Rupe reached on one out singles and were brought home by Keith Stanick's triple to left. Two more runs followed in the second, RJ Filipski singled, and was forced by Chris Schwab. Dan Euerle singled, and advanced to second base on an outfield bobble that scored Chris and then Dan himself alertly scored on a sac fly.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons wanted more and so with this mindset working full blast picked up two more runs in the third inning as Adam Bloom worked a leadoff walk. Shaun Follo then singled and both runners hustled an extra base on an infield error. Both scored on Keith's sac fly and Vernon Chin's usual single up the middle to make the score 6-0.  Gotham picked up a run in the bottom of the inning and the Falcons got that back in the fourth as Chris Schwab and Dan Euerle led off with singles and Chris came home on a Silver Bullet sac fly.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">One more run crossed the plate in the seventh on the strength of singles by the Bullet, Adam Bloom and Bob Rupe. With the Bullet's beard scoring run number eight on Rupe's base hit.  So there it is, another Falcon win as team Falcon continues its inevitable march to fulfill the club's destiny -- say on or about the end of September.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--The Falcons won this game so easily for a very good reason as the team combined timely hitting, solid fielding, strong pitching and plenty of hustle to notch the victory.  The hitting stars included Shaun Follo (two hits, two runs scored), Bob Rupe (two singles, ribbie), three more RBIs from Keith Stanick on the strength of a triple and sac fly, Vernon Chin's usual RBI single, rookie sensation Chris Schwab's two runs scored, two hits from Dan Euerle and even Bullet Bob got into the act as he drove in a run with a sac fly and of course continued his strong pitching,  allowing 1 run and just seven hits. The fielding was right on also as for the first time this year, both the infield and outfield performed flawlessly.  Hustle?...there was lots of it with heady, alert base-running from the likes of Chris Schwab, Dan Euerle and Mike Casserly standing in as the Bullet's substitute base-runner.  After the game, Adam Bloom announced that he won't be available for the next two games as he and the missus go on yet another trip: Paris?, Madrid?, Wildwood, NJ?--No--For this upper west side power couple it's off to the North Pole where they will commune with a large dude wearing blue tights and a red cape in what the guy calls the "Fortress of Solitude."  When Keith overheard Adam, basically doing what Keith does best--eavesdropping--he stated "It's funny about the large guy with the tights and red cape--that matches the description of my eye doctor who gave me the new contacts--not only can I see the stitches on the softball, I can see around corners and through walls!"…Pretty cool, don't you think?  The Silver Bullet also announced he will miss next week's game on 6/8 to make a trip to Sin City where he plans to lose as much money as possible--Lots of luck to you dude!
