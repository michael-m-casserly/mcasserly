<p class="FalconsNestText">They came from here and there, from near and far, from 1290 and from Hoboken, from Long Island and Middletown, NJ, and most of all, beautiful downtown Bayonne did the Falcons come and gather to participate in the team's biggest game of the year played last night at Diamond 1, North Meadow.  The deal was simple enough: win and advance to the playoffs, lose and go home for the winter. So the Falcons got it done defeating Smith Barney 4-1 behind the clutch hitting of Dan Euerle, Adam Bloom, and Shaun Follo, plus the brilliant pitching of the Silver Bullet.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The game started well for Team Falcon with leadoff walks to Adam Bloom and Shaun Follo. After Bob Rupe had reached on an error, Keith Stanick hit into a 6-4 double play, scoring Adam. Smith Barney then tied the score in their half of the first on a leadoff single and an error, allowing the runner to score.  But after this lone run, Smith Barney never seriously threatened again, picking up only 3 hits the rest of the way.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Meanwhile the Falcons kept threatening: A leadoff walk to Chris Schwab and Justin Picciano's single in the 2nd, but no scoring; One out walks to Adam Bloom and Shaun Follo, Bob Rupe reaching on a fielder's  choice in the 3rd and nothing; and the 4th was a 1-2-3 Inning. Finally in the 5th the Falcons broke through as Dan Euerle led off with a triple to right, and Mike Casserly reached on an error. Dan then scored as William Mills reached on an error. Adam Bloom then hit a run-scoring double, followed by Shaun Follo's sac fly, scoring William Mills' beard to tally 3 runs and the 4-1 lead. The Falcons threatened again in the 6th, loading the bases, but a force play and a pop out ended the threat. Smith Barney managed a 2-out walk in the 7th, but the Bullet induced a 4-3 groundout for the 4-1 Falcon victory.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--The hits were few and far between with Smith Barney managing just 4 hits, and the Falcons obviously doing better managing 5. But included were extra-base hits--a double from Adam Bloom that drove in a run, scored by Mike Casserly. Dan Euerle had scored prior to that after reaching on a leadoff triple to start that 5th Inning. 6 walks helped the offense along, although only 1 of those walks figured in the scoring, as the Falcons stranded 10 runners. Can't say enough about the pitching and defense as the Bullet kept Barney at bay, and other than 2 harmless errors, the D was right there at the right time. The combo of timely hitting, above-average chucking and focused fielding, if it can be maintained, should have the Falcons knocking on the door for League Title #5...Some of the numbers for the regular season are in and the leading hitters are Dan Euerle (.625 Avg., 2 homers, 8 RBI), Adam Bloom (.524 Avg. w/ 7 walks), Bob Rupe (.480 Avg. and 6 RBI), and the mysterious Winfield hit for a .500 Avg. in 5 games. The rest of the numbers will be published later...The last actual game played on 8/19 against The Knights saw the return of Hall of Fame former manager William Mills, who gave the Falcons a needed lift as the catcher and hitter showing people how to run the bases. Depending on one's thinking, either the Rickey Henderson of now or maybe Jorge Posada...Team Falcon also picked up a gift W last Friday when NASD didn't bother to show up for a double-header and forfeited both games, one of which went to the Falcons...So the Falcons are in the Playoffs for the 19th time in the last 23 years--the fun begins in about 2 weeks when we play The Lookouts in a semi-divisional contest--you'll be informed of the date, time and place soon.</p>
