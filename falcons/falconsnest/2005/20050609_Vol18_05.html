<div id="FalconsNestContent">
<p class="FalconsNestText">It was a warm, sticky yet breezy night at Diamond 1 North Meadow last night and things were even stickier for the Falcons who lost in convincing fashion to a team called the Evil Empire by the score of 10-0.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">With several stars missing, Manager Casserly used a makeshift lineup including Keith Stanick as the pitcher and placing himself in left center-field and early on things were looking OK.  With Keith pitching in his usual pattern of low pitches mixed with the higher arc in an attempt to keep the Empire batters off balance and for a while the pitching M.O. worked reasonably well; In the second inning, the Empire's first hitter smacked a triple and to left center and scored on a sac fly for the early 1-0 lead.  The Evil ones put up three more in the third on a two out, two run home-run that actually was a hard hit fly ball misjudged by Mike Casserly and the next man hit a fly ball in the same general area, this time left center-fielder Casserly managed to almost glove it, but the ball hit off the tip of his glove, the batter was credited with a triple and also scored as Mike's hurried throw went awry and the runner scored to make it 4-0.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Then Keith got into a groove retiring nine of the next ten batters, issuing just a walk. With the Falcons not doing anything offensively, managing just four hits, it was important to hold off the Empire in the final inning but it was not to be as the Empire, on the strength of six singles, a double and some base-running hustle tallied six more runs. With team Falcon going down 1-2-3 in the bottom of the seventh, the final score became 10-0 and the Falcons, standing halfway through the season now have the record of four wins, two losses.  Sounds like another 8 and 4 year to me.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--The Falcon hitting was nowhere with Keith Stanick's double in the fourth inning being the hitting highlight.  Bob Rupe hit the ball hard twice especially in the third inning when his bid for a possible home run went down the tubes as a left fielder made a circus catch, the defensive highlight of the game. Several of the Falcons stars were missing in action like Adam Bloom and his bride rediscovering their spiritual Mojo at the North Pole in the Fortress of Solitude and now looking to check out the polar bears as they wander through the garbage dumps of Churchill, Alaska; Bullet Bob playing craps and slots at the MGM Grand and willing to lose it all; Eric Sandurs striving for that Master's Degree in network development; Greg Rivera working two jobs including the midnight shift in the G. E. Building; and Justin off on one of his mysterious business trips, so this pattern will repeat itself for next week's game, to be played on 6/15. So much so that manager Mike is looking for a postponement; Did anyone notice that the Evil Empire players wore the same uniform shirts as the Gotham Empire team? Hmmm, interesting and of course the Evil guys of all looked like Kevin Millar, Jason Varitek and Johnny Damon!
