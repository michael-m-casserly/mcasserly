<p class="FalconsNestText">Keith Stanick and Vernon Chin drove in 4 RBI's each as the Falcons opened their 27th season by romping over the New York Knights at sunny, breezy Diamond 2, Great Lawn last night by the score of 12-4.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">"I've never felt better at the start of a season," declared Keith "and I owe it all to my new contacts - before when playing ball in prior years, I was like a blind man having trouble seeing pitches, especially at twilight - now I see it all."  And, it showed as the big guy responded hitting in the clean-up spot with a sac fly, a 2 run double and demonstrating a keen batting eye working a walk forcing in a run for RBI no. 4.  And Vernon (?)- playing in an ever shrinking uniform shirt responded with a run producing single in the 3rd inning and a big bases clearing double for 3 more in the 4th inning as the Falcons built to a 12-0 lead against an overwhelmed Knights club.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Overall, the contest was decided in the most telling manner as the Falcons scored 4 big ones in the bottom of the third for the early 5-0 lead.  The highlight being Keith's 2 run double to right 
center.  The Falcons then iced the game in the 4th plating 7 runs for that 12-0 lead.  "I knew 
things were going our way when Bullet Bob Kostulias led off with that seeing eye single," stated a jubilant Manager Mike after the game.  When the Falcons loaded the bases with Shaun Follo at third, Bob Rupe at second and Keith Stanick on first via the walk, Vernon Chin stepped up and lined the 3 run double to right center and himself was driven in by Winfield's big triple who scored himself on the errant outfield throw and the Mgr knew he could finally relax.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So the Falcons open up the new season with a big time win-now let's see if the momentum continues in subsequent games as Team Falcon looks for championship #5.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--Watching things from his portable luxury suite the Falcons' Mysterious Managing General Partner issued the following statement - bellowing through a bullhorn the MGP said, "Enough is enough.  I am bitterly disappointed, as I am sure all Falcon fans are, by the lack of performance by our team.  It is unbelievable to me that one of the great slo-pitch softball teams would start the season off in such a deep funk.  They're not playing like true Falcons.  They have the talent to win and they're not winning.  I expect Mike Casserly, his complete staff, including the GM and the team, to turn this around."  When 
reminded that the game hadn't started yet,the MGP quietly stated, "Just practicing," deflated his luxury suite, and skulked off to annoy people another day...So, you think only Keith and Vernon were hitting heroes-well, Bunky, think again.  Adam Bloom (3 hits, 2 runs scored), Shaun Follo (2 runs scored), Bob Rupe (2 singles, 2 runs scored), Winfield's triple and Bob Kostulias' pitching contributed big time...Did anyone notice about the 
Knights-obviously named for the fictional team from the movie The Natural- every player looked like Robert Redford!...Congrats to Dan Eurele on his recent marriage; and the good news on Pat Casserly-one more operation and his eyesight in that damaged eye will be fully restored!...The league hasn't put out the rest of the schedule, so watch your e-mails and/or phone calls for information concerning the time and place of our next game.
