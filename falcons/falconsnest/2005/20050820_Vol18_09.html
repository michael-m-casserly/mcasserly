<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons needing a win to keep the team’s playoff hopes alive pounded out 22 hits and scored 17 runs to wrack up a big w against the New York Knights at Diamond 4, North Meadow in Central Park last night.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The scoring started immediately for the Falcons in the bottom of the first inning as Scott Miller, after having reached on an error, scored on Vernon Chin’s single to centerfield. The Falcons continued building to a 3-0 lead tallying 2 runs in the 2nd as Eric Sandurs lead off with a single, Chris Schwab reached on an error by the shortstop, Dan Euerle drove in Eric with a single sending Chris to third base and Chris then scored on a Adam Bloom sac fly for the second run of the inning.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The game got interesting in the top of the third when the Knights tied things at 3. After a throwing error and a walk, the no.3 hitter smacked a 3 run homerun to right field, but after this it was all Falcons picking up 3 runs in the 4th on singles from Eric, Chris and Dan plus a force and then two more runs in the 5th scored by Shaun Follo and Keith Stanick, reaching base on consecutive singles and knocked in by R.J.Filipski and Eric Sandurs who hit consecutive singles themselves to make the score 8-3.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons then broke the game wide open in their half of the 6th scoring 9 runs on the strength of 9 singles, a double by Mike Casserly and a triple smacked by Adam Bloom. The mercy rule was finally invoked by Chief Umpire James 2 runs beyond the normal 12 runs and the final score became 17-3 although the official score will be reported to the league as 15-3. All hits that contributed to the extra runs will be counted in the team’s official stats.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--the Falcons big win was their 6th of the season making the 2 remaining games the most important of the year- win both and the Falcons stand a good chance of clinching a playoff spot but lose just one game and maybe we won’t. This was echoed by the Mysterious Managing General Partner who was in the park pretending to be a person enjoying flying a colorful kite and a very special kind of kite, because attached was a miniature video camera which the MGP expertly maneuvered into position. Looking into a small monitor, the Boss joyously observed the overall play and exclaimed: “Now that’s more like it!”….For all of you curious about what the MGP said in Spanish on Don Francisco Presenta broadcast on the Univision Network, here’s a hint: read again The Falcon’s Nest, Vol.No.18, Issue No.1....the Falcons’ hitting was tops with several players like Shaun Follo, Vernon Chin, R.J.Filipski, Dan Euerle, Mike Casserly and Chris Schwab getting multiple hits. Eric Sandurs led with 3 runs scored and several Falcons had 2 runs batted in....also a mention should be given to Keith Stanick effectively coming in as a sub for the regular pitcher Bullet Bob who was vacationing on Martha’s Vine Yard hobnobbing with people named Ted, Bill and Arnold….Next game is scheduled for Aug.26th at 6:45 in the North Meadow against an opponent to be determined so hopefully you’ll be there for some very heavy battle action.</p>
