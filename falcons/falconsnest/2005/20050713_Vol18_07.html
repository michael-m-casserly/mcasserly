<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons played another new opponent (their third in the last four games) and lost a tough one to a team called Balco. The score was 2-1 in a game played last night on Diamond 3, North Meadow, Central Park.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">As it turned out the Falcons really lost this game in the top of the 1st inning. Balco scored two runs on the strength of a leadoff single, an infield error, and another single followed for a run. A ground out to second base advanced the runners to second and third respectively, and run number 2 (unearned) scored on a single to left center for the 2-0 lead.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">At this point you could have turned off your sets right there, but not before each team had a chance to alter the outcome of the game.  For instance in the top of the 2nd, Balco's 'No. 25' hit a two-out single followed by another single to left. However, when Adam (Man of Steel) Bloom mishandled the ball, the lead runner tried to score and was called out on the relay throw.  The Falcons themselves joined the fun taking the team out of a possible rally in their half of the 2nd as RJ Filipski, after doubling, tried to advance to third base on a 6-3 ground out and was thrown out on a '3-5' play.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons picked up their lone run in the 6th as Shaun Follo hit a 1-out single, Dan Euerle walked, and Mike Casserly singled home Shaun. Following up with two runners on base, Bob Kostulias grounded into a 5-3 double play.  In the seventh inning, Scott Miller and Bob Rupe delivered 1-out singles, but Scott was thrown out at third trying to take the extra base on Bob's hit.  Next up, with Rupe standing on second base, Chris Schwab ended things by grounding out to short.  The Falcons lost their third straight game leaving the team with the 4-4 record and 5th place in the Division II standings.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--The Falcons managed just seven hits with Scott Miller chipping in with a couple of hits, RJ Filipski's double and willingness to give up his body on the field, and Shaun Follo's single and run scored.  The Bullet's pitching was right there and speaking of the Bullet, he arrived extra early to avoid the lateness problems...arriving the night before and camping out by the big tree near Diamond 3, reporting that the rats didn't annoy him at all.  Its official, Keith's name is now Stanick (pronounced St-a-a-n-i-c-k) but when he plays in the co-ed division his name is Jacques Clouseau.  On the Univision network, the mysterious MGP gave his take on the team, speaking in perfect Spanish, he stated...blah blah blah...For translation, send $1 to "Paco Translation", PO Box 5200, Tallahassee, FL...(Anyone able to and interested in reading the Spanish text in this Falcons' Nest, please ask Larry for a hard-copy)...(Editor's note: My apologies fellas, I'm sure whatever Larry wrote was great, but I barely have enough time and patience to type this stuff up in English...doing it in a foreign language, NOT A CHANCE, carrajo!!!-Mike)
