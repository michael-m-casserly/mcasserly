<div id="FalconsNestContent">

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons came to the Harlem River Drive Fields “Sports Complex” with high hopes of winning and moving on to the Division Finals especially after winning 4 games in a row to qualify for a playoff berth but it was not to be as the first place Lookouts nipped the Falcons 6-5 in regulation time to move on themselves to the Division Finals leaving Team Falcon to spend the winter thinking about what might have been.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">What might have been went something like this: the Lookouts drew first blood scoring 3 runs in the bottom of the first inning to take the early lead. The leadoff hitter started it off with a double into a very crowded left field area followed by a single, then a force play followed by a triple into that same left field area and a 2 out single for the 3-0 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons turn to score came in the 4th inning as Scott Miller and Bob Rupe lead off with singles and the mysterious Winfield bombed a dinger to that very busy with human traffic left field to tie the game at 3. The Lookouts then pulled ahead scoring a run in their half of the 4th on the strength of a single, a force and a triple to left center; but Team Falcon took the lead for the first time in the 5th inning when Dan Eurele reached on an infield error, Mike Casserly picked up double with both scoring on Adam Bloom’s triple to a less crowded right field for the 5-4 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The teams then exchanged a scoreless 6th inning and with the Falcons going down 1-2-3 in the top of the 7th, the stage was set for the fateful bottom of the inning which started with a leadoff single and after a force play, the next batter flied to left and so with a runner on first and 2 outs, things are looking good for the Falcons and then the roof caved in as the Lookouts exploded for 3 straight hits,  two singles scoring a run for the tie and the final hitter rapping a screaming line drive over R.J.Filipski’s head in right field to score the winning run. The bottom line is the Lookouts play again and the Falcons go home. Hey- does anyone want to play Snowflake Softball?</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--The Falcons managed to squeeze the 5 runs out of only 7 hits bunching their runs in 2 innings. Hitting heroes included Adam Bloom (walk, triple), Winfield's 3 run homerun and Mike Casserly's double that preceded Adam's triple...Fielding was mostly good which included Mike Casserly's relay throw to home plate resulting in a tag on the runner that would have meant a 5th run in the 4th inning and a circus catch by R.J.Filipski in right field to end the 5th inning...And the pitching? - After a shaky start when he allowed a double and triple plus 2 singles in the top of the first inning that scored 3 runs, Bullet Bob  settled down nicely giving up a run in the 4th and then retiring 6 out of the next 7 batters until the fateful 7th inning when he was unable to close the deal allowing the game ending runs to score...Even though the loss was tough to take and the mood of the team reflected it, the Falcons through their GM managed to present the 2004 regular season Most Valuable Player Trophy and for the second consecutive year to Bob Rupe. Bob in his emotional acceptance remarks stated once again: "You like me, you really, really like me!"...From What They'll Be Doing During The Off Season Dept: It's been announced that the Falcons in partnership with the guy who produces The Apprentice have struck a TV deal for a reality show to be called "Boogying with the Falcons" that will have ladies partnering with team members in a dance off – for example ballroom dancing with Vernon, tango with Greg Rivera, polka with Can-Do, twist with William, and do the funky chicken with The Bullet. The  winning couple will receive free passes to Roseland...A reference was made to the crowded left field area that made fielding difficult; basically it was due to two groups of guys "scrimmaging" at football but trying very hard to blend in was the Falcons' Mysterious Managing General Partner (he was the one wearing the gold football helmet) watching and observing and finally witnessing the final debacle, ranted "about making things better in 2006" and for starters announced a change in the Falcons formula for winning- from now on it's the Falcons slogan of Pride and Hustle plus Talent and here's the new part: Consistency in all phases of the game (including scorekeeping) which should equal Championship.</p>
