<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons returned to the softball wars after a month's layoff and the rust showed as our old rivals defeated Team Falcon 16 - 5 at muggy, showery Diamond 1, Great Lawn in Central Park last night.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">With R.J. Filipski subbing in for a late arriving Bob Kostulias, the Graham's opened the scoring right away picking up five runs (three of which were unearned) on the basis of two singles, a walk, a sac fly and three infield errors.  Another run was scored in the second inning on a sac fly to left after the Graham's had loaded the bases on two singles and an error.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">But now the Falcons struck back in their half of the second. Inspired by the Silver Bullet's arrival, the team went to work. Vernon Chin and Mike Coen singled and after a pop to second, Greg Rivera delivered a sac fly scoring Vernon. This was followed by a walk to Chris Schwab and run-producing singles by Eric Sandurs and Mike Casserly with Eric thrown out at the plate try to score on Mike's base hit.  Another Falcon run was added in the third inning on Shaun Follo's sac fly scoring Bullet Bob's beard after the Bullet had walked and the sub runner had advanced to third on an Adam Bloom single to right.  The Falcons then added 2 more run in the fourth as Winfield scored on Greg Rivera's single.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So now the game stands at 6-5 Grahams, things are looking up, the Bullet is on the mound shutting the opposition down and then it happens...The Grahams exploded for six runs on the basis of five singles, a walk and 2 errors to make the score 12-5.  Adding insult to injury, the Graham's picked up four more runs in the sixth on the strength of four hits...When the number five hitter doubled home two runs, the umpire invoked the mercy rule and the game was suddenly ended.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So the Falcons take a tough loss, the record is 4 and 3 and the team is at a pivotal moment in the season with next week's Tuesday night game the most important contest of the year - a must game if there ever was one.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--The Falcons managed nine hits only (one less than the Grahams) with Greg Rivera's sac fly and ribbie single a highlight, plus Mike Coen's two runs scored, Vernon Chin's single and a run scored and Shaun Follo's sac fly.  The real problem was the fielding as the Falcons committed by the official scorer's count seven errors, most contributing to the 16 runs; so the big goal is to tighten up the D against a team we have not played before - Balco.  The night marked a return of some of the team's stars like Adam Bloom who reported on his trip to the northern climbs and to his love of reindeer meat; Bullet Bob who is being forced to go back to work as a limo driver ferrying high rollers to Atlantic City because he lost it all on a five day binge in Vegas; and Eric Sandurs playing hooky from NYU in his drive to become the world's most educated computer specialist.  Bob Rupe finally received his 2003 MVP trophy and upon accepting it from that can do man, cried out to his teammates "You like me, you really like me!"  By the way, the mysterious managing general partner is observing things and we'll have a state of the team evaluation to be published in the next Nest...
