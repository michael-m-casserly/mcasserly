<p class="FalconsNestText">It wasn't looking good last night for the Falcons at the beginning of the game, with a substitute pitcher on the mound, specifically Keith Stanick, the Lookouts got off to a great start tallying eight runs in the first three innings to jump off to an eight zip lead. Things were looking bleak and then he came barreling into view: the Silver Bullet - the Falcons' regular chucker had arrived to the tune of "pomp and circumstance" much like his sports idol Mariano Rivera and declared himself good to go after two warm-up pitches. Bob K proceeded on this chilly, breezy night at Diamond 1 - North Meadow to shut the door on a strong hitting Lookout club, enabling team Falcon to rally by putting on a hitting clinic to pick up ten runs for the eventual victory.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">That rally began immediately in the bottom of the third: a one out walk to the Bullet, singles by Adam Bloom and Scott Miller (each for a run), a Bob Rupe single, a Keith Stanick sac fly to left and an RBI single from Vernon Chin for run number three.  After loading the bases in the fourth which led nowhere, the Falcons broke the game open, touching the plate for seven runs in the fifth: Rupe and Stanick led off with walks, Vernon singled to load the bases, RJ then reached on an infield error for a run, Shaun Follo hit a sac fly, Dan Euerle doubled for one run, Mike Casserly tripled home two runs, the Silver Bullet reached on an E-5, Adam Bloom singled for a run, Scott singled, Bob Rupe singled for a run and after a walk to Keith, Vernon flied to left for out number three.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Meanwhile, the Bullet kept doing his thing...for example in the sixth inning, the Lookouts picked up an infield hit, then their lead-off hitter then lined a shot to Dan Euerle for our number two. The next batter then singled off Bob Rupe's glove but a budding rally was stifled on an unassisted force at short.  The seventh inning was a routine 1-2-3 and that man and the Falcons had their third straight victory.
</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Notes</i>--And who was that dude known as the Silver Bullet - for the answer see below. The excellent Falcon hitting continued with major contributions from Adam Bloom (two walks, two singles, ribbie), two more hits from Scott Miller, a couple of hits from the steady Bob Rupe (scoring a run and driving in a run) Dan Euerle getting busy with three hits and a ribbie plus sac flies by Shaun Follo and Keith Stanick...and by the way is it Stanick or Stancik?, everyone please vote and send in your ballot to manager Mike ASAP, so Keith can have a last name that he can call his own. Falcons also overcame some sloppy outfield play (about half the Lookouts runs were unearned) by flashing some infield leather, especially Dan Euerle's glove work at third base...Falcons' next game is on Tuesday against Money (Maximum) Capital--same place at 7:00 PM. So who is this Silver Bullet? It's the Lone Ranger!  -- just kidding kemo sabe… of course it's Bullet Bob Kostulias…
