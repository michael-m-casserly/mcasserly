<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons, with some new faces in the lineup, continued their winning ways with a resounding victory, their second of the year against Mel in a game played at sun-drenched Diamond 6 Great Lawn last night.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The contest started off shakily for the Falcons when with a runner on first, the Casserly Brothers collided on a short fly with the collision knocking brother Pat out of the game with a bruised knee and a knock on the head. But no further damage occurred as the Mel couldn't capitalize eventually stranding two runners.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons meanwhile came storming out of the box scoring 8 runs in the first inning that featured a lead off double by Greg Rivera and ended with a 2 run double by Mike Casserly. In between there were run-producing singles from Keith Stanick, newcomer Mike Ardizzone, Shaun Follo and Vernon Chin among other hits.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So with the score standing at 8-0, the Falcons wanted to keep it going and so they picked up 2 as Keith reached on a throwing error, scored from second on Shaun Follo's double who then scored himself on newcomer Curt's single to center. Those Mel dudes managed their lone run in the top of the third when after loading the bases picked up that run on a sac fly. But the Falcons weren't through scoring plating 2 more in the bottom of the third for the 12-1 lead. The key hit came off the bat of Keith Stanick and his two run double to left.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Now it's the fourth inning and Team Falcon can't help it making the score 14-1 on a single by Scott Miller, the mysterious 'Curt' drove home Scott on a booming triple to right and then scored himself on a force. For good measure the Falcons came up with one more run. After Ardizzone and Follo had singled, Scott Miller drove home Mike A. on a single to left. The Mel wanted to play one more inning for the practice and promptly went down 1-2-3. Game over, t-h-h-e  F-a-l-c-o-n-s  w-i-n-n!!</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons rapped out 19 hits to produce those 15 runs with everyone in the lineup reaching base -- a quick summary: Greg Rivera's patented double to lead off, Dan Euerle (2 for 2, 2 runs scored), Keith Stanick (2 hits, 3 ribbies), Shaun Follo (3 hits, ribbie), Vernon Chin (ribbie single), 2 hits, 2 walks from Scott Miller, the Mysterious 'Curt' with a single, a triple and 2 ribbies, and finally Mike Casserly with his 2-run double...a big thanks to Mike Ardizzone, Justin Seconi and 'Curt', friends of Keith and Shaun who took time to come down to help out...Speaking of the mysterious 'Curt' apparently he doesn't have a last name, so lets vote to give him one: choose from the following: (a) Muldoon, (b) Mayfield, (c) Schilling, (d) Ryan or (e) Skarantonakis -- send your vote to "give Curt a last name contest" c/o The Mysterious Managing General Partner, Box No. 1, Neptune, NJ. Winner gets to go to the next do-wop concert held at the Garden...Our buddy Adam Bloom was unable to attend the game -- he and Kasia are helping to edit the show they did on their trip to Central Europe. They and their fellow hosts, Justine, Megan and Ian will all appear on this particular episode of Globe Trekker which will be shown on a PBS station nearest you in the fall...On a serious note, I missed the first out made in the bottom of the first inning, if anyone knows who it is let me know...Meanwhile our next game is on 7/18 at 5:45 on the Great Lawn -- I won't be attending, so someone please keep the score book or the Mysterious MGP will kill us!</p>
