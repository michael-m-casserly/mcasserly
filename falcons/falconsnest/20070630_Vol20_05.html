<p class="FalconsNestText">It was a breezy, cool night at Diamond 1, Great Lawn last night as the field became the scene of another Falcon victory as Team Falcon ran its record to 7-0 retaining sole possession of first place in Division 2 play by defeating the second place team Balco by the score of 7-3.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons opened the scoring in the bottom of the first with leadoff singles from Adam Bloom and Pat Casserly with both runners advancing a base because of an outfield error. Adam then scored on a force and Keith Stanick drove in Pat on a single to left center. Team Falcon increased the lead to 3 zip in the bottom of the second when RJ Filipski reached second base on a throwing error and RJ then scored on a single by newcomer Rob Boller.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Balco staged a rally of their own in the next inning scoring 2 on the basis of 2 errors surrounding a triple by the no.3 hitter. Both runs were unearned. But the Falcons kept coming with 2 more runs in the fourth with consecutive leadoff singles from the Url Man, RJ and Shaun Follo and then Euerle and RJ scored on a clutch double to center field by the returning Todd Ames.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Now with the score standing at 5-2, the Falcons wanted more and so in the bottom of the fifth, the Falcons picked up 2 more runs as Pat Casserly reached on an error, Bob Rupe singled and both were driven home by Keith Stanick with yet another clutch hit, this time a triple to right. After a single and a walk, Keith attempted to score on RJ Filipski's ground ball but was thrown out at the plate. So with the bases loaded and one out, the Falcons couldn't pull the trigger on any more runs as Shaun and Rob flied out to end the rally.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Balco tried a last ditch rally of their own in the seventh: a single, a walk, a force and a RBI single produced a run but yes that guy pitcher Keith Stanick induced a pop to short and a ground out to give the Falcons their 7th victory of the season.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--Speaking of Keith, not did he only excel at the plate with 2 big hits and 3 ribbies, he also turned in a sparkling pitching performance scattering 8 hits allowing the 3 runs only one of which was earned...The Falcons managed just 10 hits themselves distributed among several players with Todd Ames' clutch 2 run double a highlight...There must have been a giveaway, probably a Bullet Bob Kostulias bobbin' head doll, because I counted at least 15 "fans" watching the game, either hanging on the nearby fence or watching from the park benches - we should've charged admission-it's the American way...Speaking of the Bullet - as I've already reported, Bob was elected to the Falcons Hall of Fame therefore there will be an "induction ceremony" if we could only get him to take off his turban...Kasia (Mrs. Adam) Bloom showed up with the family dog and excitedly described their trip to her native land recounting their grueling 500-mile bike ride from Berlin, the bug bites, the close calls on the Autobahn, their arrival, the reunions with her look-a-like cousins and also the co-hosts of Globe Trekker: Justine Shapiro, Megan McCormick and Ian Wright and course all that food, the kielbasy, the stuffed cabbage, the babka and the inevitable weight gain - it was topped by the dog barking twice - doggie language for "Lets go Falcons"...Don't forget - our next game is on 7/12 at Diamond 6 on the Great Lawn at 5:45 pm where once again we will play The Mel.</p>
