<p class="FalconsNestText">The streakin' freakin' Falcons continued their winning ways overcoming an early deficit to defeat Cobra Kai aka 'Aces Wild' by the score of 11-6 at breezy Diamond 1, North Meadow in a game played on May 23rd. The victory put the Falcons' record at 4 wins and no losses, the best start for a Falcons team since 1990.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Speaking of starts, the Cobra got it going right away scoring 4 in the top of the first inning, the key hits being run producing consecutive doubles and a single for another run to make the score 4-0. But a deficit of 4 runs is nothing to a team like the Falcons who proved it by scoring 6 runs in the bottom of the inning. Key hits included a sac fly off the bat of Greg Rivera and a bases clearing 3 run triple by Dan (my name is Url) Euerle.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Cobra Aces Wild Kai came back though in the top of the second tying the game at 6 on the strength of a sac fly and a ribbie single by the no. 3 hitter. This infuriated the mysterious Winfield who was doing the chucking for Team Falcon: "either I was going to reach for my ankle holster or settle down and pitch my game" stated W after the game and fortunately he chose the latter shutting down Cobra the rest the way.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons themselves weren't through scoring as they picked up 3 in the third on consecutive singles by Greg Rivera and Scott Miller and after Shaun Follo singled, Euerle came through with a sac fly and Mike Casserly followed with a 2 run triple. Then in the 4th picked up 2 more on a Pat Casserly double, Winfield reached on an 'E5', Mr. Chin plopped a single for a run and after Rivera had singled, Scott Miller lined a RBI single to left center. While both teams threatened mildly after this, there was no more scoring and the Falcons took the game by that final score of 11-6.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--When a team scores 11 runs on 13 hits you can expect some hitting heroes and Tuesday's game was no exception: try Vernon Chin's usual run producing single, Pat Casserly contributed with a walk and 2 hits plus 2 runs scored, a couple of hits, a sac fly and a RBI from Greg Rivera, 3 hits plus a ribbie from Scott Miller, the big triple plus a sac fly from Dan Euerle and a triple that drove in 2 off the bat of Mike Casserly...After a shaky start, Mr. Winfield settled down to shut down Cobra after allowing 6 runs, 5 earned in the first 2 innings: "When I saw my pitches falling short, I adjusted my delivery to break almost on top of the plate and once I did that Cobra didn't stand a chance" stated a jubilant Mysterious W as he changed into his blue working uniform--as he adjusted his piece, he bid his team mates adieu, promising to return 'the next time real soon'...By now everyone knows there were problems with publishing the newsletter and scoring the last two games--keep this in mind: the keeping and publishing of the stats is part of the Falcon way of doing things so lets keep this important function alive and well...The Mysterious Managing General Partner watched at a nearby field disguised as a Star Wars Storm Trooper because he was coming from a Star Wars Convention and liked what he saw and simply said: "the Falcons are Boss and keep up good work or else"...Our next game is May 30th at 7:00 at Diamond 6, North Meadow--see you all then...</p>
