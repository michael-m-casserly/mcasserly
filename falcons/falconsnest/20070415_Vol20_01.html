<div id="FalconsNestContent">

<p class="FalconsNestText">It was 'Freeze Your Ass Off Night' at a very cold Diamond 6 at the Heckscher in Central Park as the Falcons rallied late to overcome a 9-6 deficit to notch their first victory of the 2007 season edging last year's co-champions Balco by the score of 10-9.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Things looked bad early on as Balco opened the scoring in the top of the first plating 5 runs on the strength of 3 singles, a sac fly and 2 homeruns. The Falcons then struck back in the bottom of the inning scoring 2 runs on a single by Pat Casserly, Bob Rupe reached on an error committed by the pitcher, Keith Stanick reached on a force and Vernon Chin drove in two with hard hit single after an error allowed Keith to reach second base.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Balco picked up a couple of runs in the top of the 3rd to extend their lead to a 7-2 but the Falcons cut the Balco lead scoring 4 runs in the bottom of the inning. After Bob Rupe had reached on an error by the third baseman, Keith Stanick stepped up and blasted a homer to left center, Vernon singled again and newcomer Tim Ryan lined to the shortstop, Chris Schwab singled, Shaun Follo reached on a yet another Balco error and Dan Euerle delivered a single to drive in both runners.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">So now the score is 7-6 and Balco pulled ahead again in the 5th scoring a deuce to make the score 9-6 but the never say die Falcons rallied in the bottom of the 5th scoring 3 big runs to tie the game at 9. A key hit in this sequence was a double by Tim Ryan scoring Vernon on base with his third hit of the night.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Now the game is tied, the light is just about gone, it's getting colder by the second and the umpire decides to play one more inning and after Balco goes down in order, the Falcons get a chance for a win and Team Falcon delivers the goods as Bob Rupe reaches on an error for the third time and hitting hero Keith Stanick drives a ball into the twilight for the gamer scoring Bob to seal the big victory.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The 2007 season marks the 29th year of the Falcon franchise (27 actually playing) and who would have thought it possible that it would last this long which means we'll look forward to year no. 30 in 2008!...Falcons started off the new season in fine fashion especially in the hitting dept. coming up with 14 hits that produced the 10 runs helped along by poor defense by Balco including 5 errors...Keith Stanick of course had the big night going 3 for 4 including a homer and 3 ribbies, 3 hits and a ribbie from Vernon Chin, a key RBI double from Tim Ryan, Shaun Follo delivering a run producing single in the 5th inning rally and acting manager Dan Euerle delivering a 2 run single in the 3rd inning 4 run rally...defense was also stellar especially in the infield and Pitcher Keith Stanick ultimately settled down to shut the door on Balco...the major cold weather got so bad that penguins were seen marching across the outfield although one looked like the Mysterious Managing General Partner in disguise checking up on his team...don't forget our next game is on 4/27 at 7:00 PM in the North Meadow at Diamond 6.</p>
