<p class="FalconsNestText"> The so called “scouting report” on Grandchester was “kind of mediocre-5 and 7ish” said this source and the word went out on the bench and maybe the defending champs didn’t take Grandchester as seriously as they could have or should have and the result was a rather lackluster performance in a losing cause as the Grand beat the Falcons 5-3 at coolish Diamond 1 in the North Meadow Wednesday night.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The runs and hits were few and far between with the Falcons going down in order in the first 2 innings with the Grandchester left fielder making a circus catch on Keith Stanick’s bid for at least a triple in the 2nd inning. Meanwhile Chester picked up a run as the leadoff hitter in the first inning reached on an outfield error, advanced to third on a second outfield error and later scored on a single. They then picked up another run in the second inning on a couple of base hits and the Falcons’ third error for the 2-0 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">But the Falcons came back to tie the game at 2 in the top of the third as Greg Rivera singled, newcomer R.J. Filipski reached on an error, a couple of more errors, some daring base running and a Vernon Chin single got it done. Grandchester made the game 3-2 in the bottom of the inning on a single advancing to second on a throwing error and a double. The Grand extended their lead to 5-2 in the fifth inning on a one out single advancing to second base on a throwing error and 3 singles before an inning ending double play started in spectacular style by Adam Bloom.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Team Falcon tried again in the sixth inning when with two outs, Eric Sandurs singled, and so did Keith Stanick. Then the new guy Alberto Hernandez reached on an error by the pitcher scoring Eric; but Justin Picciano flied to left center to end the threat. The same pattern repeated in the final inning with hits from Greg and Pat Casserly but both runners were stranded and the final score was 5-3 making the Falcons’ won/lost record 1 and 1.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes...</i>Falcons could only manage 8 hits like Greg Rivera garnering 2 as did Pat Casserly with Keith Stanick getting robbed twice on his bids for extra base hits adding to the frustration. There were also 4 errors that figured in the scoring but on the plus side Adam Bloom shined at second base especially on that inning ending double play in the fifth inning….The Falcons inability to deliver the key hit resulted in stranding 8 runners, not a winning formula for winning softball games-the bottom line is not to take any team for granted and not be influenced by somebody else’s “opinion”….a word about the schedule: the decision was made about the later starting times because of the work hours, traveling from remote locations, etc. dictated to go mostly @ 7:00- more on that later….meanwhile the next game will take place on 5/27 @ 7;00 P.M. at Diamond 8- Great Lawn. Hope you’ll be there!</p>
