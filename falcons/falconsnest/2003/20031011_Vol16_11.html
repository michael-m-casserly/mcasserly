<p class="FalconsNestText">Stage 5 Run Comeback Rally - Edge Nomads 12-11...Win Second Straight Division Title</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons arrived at Dewitt Clinton Field for their 7:30 game against a team they had not seen since 1999.  Not knowing much about their opponent, but also realizing the importance of this game:  Win the Division 2 Title and win the right to move further in the playoffs, lose and the season is over.  So what do defending champs do it this situation?  Why, they get the job done and pull out a dramatic come from behind victory over the Nomads 12-11 - For the Division Title and move on to the next round of the playoffs.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons opened the scoring in the bottom of the first with leadoff walks to Adam Bloom and William Mills and with one out, Aaron Scheid doubled home Adam with Aaron taking third on the throw and scored on Keith Stanick's sac fly to left center.  Then the hard-hitting Nomads went to work themselves scoring 4 in the top half of the second for the lead, this rally included 2 doubles and an error.  But then the Falcons in their half of the second tied the score on the strength of a 2 out clutch triple by Mike Casserly scoring Scott Miller and Eric Sandurs who had reached on a single and a walk respectively.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The scoring continued in the next inning with the Nomads tallying 5 in what proved to be their last really good inning of the game.  That featured a couple of doubles, a couple of walks and a 2 run single by the leadoff hitter for the 9-4 lead.  The Falcons then started to peck away scoring 2 in the third on Bob Rupe's double, a triple from Aaron and a ribbie from Keith.  After the Nomads scored a run in the 4th, the Falcons continued to patiently whittle down the lead in their half of the 4th scoring 3 runs before running themselves out of what could have been even a bigger rally when Scott Miller, pinch running for Bob Kostulias was thrown out at the plate trying to score on a William Mills single.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">And on the same play, Adam Bloom who had previously walked attempted to take third and was thrown out by the catcher to end the inning.  Sometimes plays like this can discourage a team, but the Falcons didn't let it get them down.  Finally in the 5th the Falcons moved ahead as Bob Rupe, leading off with a double (his second of the game) was driven in by a big triple from a hot-hitting Keith Stanick with Vernon Chin delivering the key blow, a single for the go ahead run - driving in Keith.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Now the score is 11-10 Falcons and remained so until the 7th Inning.  Here the Nomads with their backs to the wall, facing elimination, scored the tying run:  After an error, a fielder's choice, and with 2 outs, their No. 9 hitter delivered a clutch triple to tie the game.  But then Bullet Bob K bore down and got out No. 3 on a fly to left center, stranding the runner.  So now it was the Falcons turn for some dramatics:  Aaron Scheid worked a 1 out walk and that man again Keith Stanick stepped up and bombed a game-winning triple to left center scoring Aaron and the Falcons take the win and the Division and now move on to the next round to be played on October 17th at Dewitt Clinton, against the Panthers.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>...Falcons' patience meaning working the counts, getting walks, etc. resulted in more base runners for our big bombers to deliver those clutch hits that translated into a winning score as once again the middle of the lineup delivered the goods like Bob Rupe emerging from his mini-slump with 2 big doubles and 2 runs scored -- Aaron Scheid's double, triple, a clutch walk in the 7th Inning plus 2 RBIs, Keith Stanick's big night with a sac fly, single and the 2 triples plus 4 ribbies with of course the second of those triples turning out to be the gamer.  Vernon Chin's clutch hit that gave us the go ahead run in the 5th Inning, a couple of hits from Scott Miller and a big time 2 RBI triple from Mike Casserly to tie the score at 4 in the 2nd inning.  Bob Kostulias settling down after a shaky start and pitching well in the final 3 innings - "Except for that triple in the 7th - I was trying to get the dude to pop up" moaned the Flash and promises to be more "there" in the next game...Speaking of Vernon, I made a mistake by giving him credit for a key single that kept our big rally going in the game against the Moonlight Grahams -- Actually it was Scott Miller, but Vernon realizing my mistake after reading the last Nest said "Why can't I really do it too" and so he did as mentioned above... Falcons welcomed back Adam's dad Ron "Mr." Bloom who reported that his hammy that he pulled in his one game from last year is fully healed.  But also The Mister complained about the height of his trophy: "It wasn't tall enough, I thought it would be much bigger, like about 4 feet tall" -- We'll see what we can do the next time...The Mysterious Managing Partner showed up watching his team in action from his stretch pickup truck from the street - stroking his pet person cat with the green eyes, the MGR stated that he liked what he saw because as he said: "Winning is second only to breathing"...Our next game will be played on Oct. 17th at Dewitt Clinton -- 6:00PM -- We'll play the Division 1 winners The Panthers.  Hopefully the A-team will be down on 10/17 - this next game promises to be the toughest game yet (Although our B-team so-called, handled things quite well last Friday) -- So watch out for those emails and/or phone calls from the manager, etc.</p>
