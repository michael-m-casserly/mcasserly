<p class="FalconsNestText">Diamond 6 North Meadow was the scene of an exciting game as Max Capital defeated the Falcons 3-2 in extra innings on Friday night.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The game itself was a battle all the way through to the end with the Falcons striking first as Keith Stanick lead off the top of the 2nd with a single and there followed consecutive singles by Aaron Scheid, Mike Coen and Adam  Bloom scoring both Keith and Aaron. Capital picked up a run in the 3rd and tied things in the 5th on the strength of  2 singles and a couple of fielder’s choice plays.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Both teams had scoring chances after the 5th, for example in the bottom of the 6th, Capital put two runners on via a walk and a single but with one out the runner on 2nd base ran himself into a force as Dan Euerle caught a popup forcing this runner and the batter for an unassisted double play.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons had chances themselves especially in the fateful 9th inning as the first 2 batters, Pat Casserly and Dan Euerle reached on singles but the last 3 batters, Mike Casserly, Bob Kostulias and Mike McGuigan were retired in order and the number of Falcons stranded totaled 9 for the evening. This set the stage for the bottom of the 9th as Capital’s leadoff hitter reached on a single and after moving to second on a 5-3 groundout, scored the winning run on a solid single to left center to make the final score  3-2.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes...</i>Both teams played in a similar fashion like the Falcons managing 11 hits all singles with just about everyone in the lineup getting 1 hit each and Maximum Capital picking up 13 hits stranding 9 runners themselves...both the Falcons and Max Capital pitched well but the Max pitcher/manager pulled a snarky stunt when he deliberately threw a flat pitch to Mike Casserly who unfortunately took a swing fouling off the pitch for the k. I believe the rule is don’t swing and the umpire calls no pitch or a ball. Happily no other incidents took place for the rest of the game thank God...Former Mgr. Mills made his seasonal debut and his usual astute observation has picked up some tips on how to hit against Tim the Capital pitcher plus some other ideas on making the Falcons a stronger team. Hey! They don’t call him the ‘Sage of Softball’ for nothing...Next on the schedule- a doubleheader to be played on 7/28- 2 very important games so be there already!</p>
