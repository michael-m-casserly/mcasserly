<p class="FalconsNestText">9 run 7th inning caps comeback - Division 2 Title Game up next.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Playing their first game at a dusty Dewitt-Clinton complex located at 52nd Street and 11th Ave., the Falcons won the first round playoff game against the Moonlight Grahams.  Coming from behind to polish off the Grahams 17-9 allowing the Falcons to advance to the next round which will decide the winner of Division 2.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The game itself was a doozy with the Falcons jumping out to an early lead stinging the Grahams in the top of the 1st with 3 runs resulting from a walk to Bob Rupe and something that hasn't been seen much this year and that's power hitting, in this case, back to back homers from Aaron Scheid and Keith Stanick.  3 more runs came in the 2nd on doubles from Greg Rivera and a run producing double from Dan Euerle and after a 2 out walk and a single, Mr. Mills drove in a run with a single (the previous single by Pat Casserly had driven in Dan).</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Now the score is 6-1 and the Grahams began to whittle the lead scoring 2 in their half of the 2nd and 1 more in the 4th after the Falcons had picked up a run in the top of the 4th driven in by Bob Kostulias' single to make things 7-4.  The Falcons then added a run in the 6th on Mike Coen's home run to deep left and so with their backs to the wall the Grahams staged a rally of their own scoring 5 runs after 2 were out.  The key hit being a 3 run home run helped along by an infield error that helped the rally to keep going and now the Grahams have the 9-8 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So now it's the Falcons turn to have their backs to the wall, so what do you do when the season is on the line?  Why you rally yourself to take the lead:  A leadoff walk to Eric Sandurs and after a foul pop out, Manager Mike bombs a 2 run homer to left center to take back the lead and the fun begins. Pat Casserly reaches on a fielder's choice after a walk to Kostulias, 2 errors followed, a single from Aaron, a Keith Stanick run producing double, a big single from Scott Miller for a run.  And to cap it off, a 2 run home run bomb by Mike Coen to left center and guess what it is now 17-9 Falcons.  The Grahams go down easily in the bottom of the 7th and the Falcons win a big one.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>...After a regular season of struggling for hits and runs, the Falcons are starting to show power just at the right time.  Hitting heroes included Aaron Scheid (Homer, Single, 2 Ribbies), Keith Stanick (Homer, Double, 2 RBIs), Scott Miller's big time single, Vernon Chin's key hit in the 7th inning rally drove in a run, important doubles from Greg Rivera and Dan Euerle.  Manager Mike's big 2 run dinger in the 7th and most of all Mike Coen's 2 home runs for 3 ribbies...Falcons, as represented by the Falcon Fan presented Former Manager Mills with a plaque honoring Bill on his 20 years with the team - "I'll cherish it always" stated William as he brushed away a tear (Aw!)...The Falcon win puts us in the Division 2 Title Game as mentioned above.  We will play the winner of the Max Capital/Nomads game to be played Tuesday.  Our game is scheduled for Friday October 10th at 7:30PM - location is once again Dewitt Clinton - So our A-Team bringing down our A-Game needs to show up for playoff battle action!...</p>
