<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons opened their 25th year by downing a strong Los Guapos team at the ice bowl known as Diamond 2 on the frozen Great Lawn Wednesday night and in the process of winning displayed the same gritty determination that characterized last year’s championship team with the usual come from behind heroics by scoring a solid 8-6 victory over a new team in the league called Los Guapos.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The beginning of this contest didn’t start off well for the Falcons as Los Guapos got off to a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first on a homerun by the leadoff hitter and later a sac fly and picked up another run on a single and a triple by the very same leadoff hitter in the bottom of the third. So the score is 3 zip and someone on the Falcon bench said “its show time!” and so the Falcons went to work in the top of the fourth when with one out, Vernon Chin bounced a single up the middle and after Bob Rupe flied out, Keith Stanick singled, Mike Coen rocked a triple to left and scored on Chris Paper’s infield hit who advanced to second on the errant throw. Returning veteran Justin Piccano then rapped a hard single to left scoring Chris, Pat Casserly bopped a hit that scored Justin and that looks like 5 runs and a 5-3 lead!</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"> The Falcons added 3 more runs in the top of the 5th as Mike Casserly led off with a single and advanced to second base on a poor throw, Bob Kostulias lined a clutch  double to score Mike and Bob’s beard scored himself after newcomer/pinch hitter Scott Miller singled the runner to third base and Adam Bloom hit a sac fly to score a run. One more run scored after a Vernon Chin walk and a single by Bob Rupe, I believe the ball was thrown around allowing the run to score for the 8-4 lead. Los Guapos had picked up a run in the 4th and then closed the scoring with two more runs in the bottom of the 5th with the game called for darkness-final score 8-6 Falcons to get win no.1.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes...</i>You want hitting heroes?-try Vernon Chin(2 runs scored), Mike Coen(triple,2 ribbies), Chris Paper(1 for 2, run scored), Justin Piccano’s run producing single and Bob Kostulias’ clutch double for a ribbie plus the usual solid pitching as well….Falcons welcomed newcomers Scott Miller and Alberto Hernandez; they and others who were not available last night will see action as the season wears on….a new feature in this 25th anniversary year called Falcon Memories which are remembrances from various Falcon veterans- first up: the Falcon Fan: “This happened in March 1978- I’m slaving over a hot desk when co worker Ken Simeone, fed up with a crazy boss, comes charging out of his cubby hole sized “office” with a wild look in his eyes and exclaimed: ‘Let’s start a softball team!’” and so the forerunner of the Falcons named Financial Management Staff was born and now 117 regular season wins , 3 divisional titles and 4 championships in 3 different leagues later, the Falcons are boss and Ken himself continues to be on the 60 month DL with a chronic hangnail….next game will be on 5/2 at the Falcons’ old stomping grounds where we won 3 games that gave us 3 out of the 4 championships and that would be Diamond 11- North Meadow at 7:00 P.M. Please be there already!</p>
