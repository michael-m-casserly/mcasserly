<p class="FalconsNestText">So you would think that only Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire could do splits but you would be wrong because so can the Falcons and they proved it by playing a doubleheader at Diamond 3 North Meadow on a beautiful night weather wise winning the first game and then losing the nightcap.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The first game against an undermanned Grandchester team saw the Falcons on the strength of a 5 run 2nd inning defeat Grandchester 6-4. The 5 runs were scored when Vernon Chin singled, Aaron Scheid doubled and both were driven home on Pat Casserly's official double, the latter being tagged out attempting to stretch it into a triple. A hit from Dan Eurele followed, William Mills reached, Bob Kostulias drove home Eurele and Keith Stanick's single brought home William and Bob's sub runner Mike Casserly for the 5-2 lead. While Grandchester chipped away a bit, the Falcons picked up an insurance run in the bottom of the 3rd and the disadvantaged Chester team using only 8 players could not overcome the Falcons’ lead and the game ended in a Falcon W 6-4.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Unfortunately the second game turned out differently for Team Falcon; like in the first game, the Falcons bunched together, this time 3 runs in the 2nd inning, the big blow a Dan Eurele double that Pat Casserly to score run no.3 in the inning after Bob Rupe and Greg Rivera had scored earlier. This lead held up with Bob Kostulias pitching one of his best games and so came the fateful 7th inning- with the Falcons leading 4-1, things looked good for the sweep especially with one out but suddenly the roof caved in: 3 consecutive singles, a critical throwing error from the outfield, a sac fly, 2 more singles, a walk and the gamer, a line single to left and Smith Barney, Falcons' opponent for the evening coming out on top 5-4 in earning the dramatic come from behind victory. The split gives the Falcons a 5 and 4 won loss record for the season.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes...</i>The Falcons continued with their mini batting slump that started with the Max Capital game played on 7/25- a game lost by the Falcons 3-2 in 9 innings...In the first game the Falcons managed 13 hits producing the 6 runs with Vernon Chin (2 hits, 2 runs scored), Aaron Scheid (double, single, run scored), Pat Casserly's 2 run double, 2 hits from Dan Eurele and Keith Stanick's 2 run single leading the hitting...The hits were harder to come by in the second game with the Falcons managing only 8 hits: Bob Rupe had 2 with a run scored, Pat Casserly had a run producing single and Dan Euerle's double drove in a run...Bob Kostulias pitched well but is feeling down about the loss-reaching for a chop that glanced off his glove that kept the rally by Smith Barney going. "If I hadn't interfered, the ball probably would've been fielded cleanly for a force and we would have gotten the victory" lamented Bob- hey those are the breaks better luck next time...Like I said earlier we are now 5 and 4 - we need to win the last 3 games and forget about last year- its old news. The final push for a playoff spot begins on Aug.8th at 7:00 at Diamond 6 in the North Meadow so be there already!</p>
