<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons came to Diamond 1 North Meadow with concerns about the playoff picture - could the team come alive both in hitting and fielding and come through with a much needed victory to stay in the playoff hunt? This is exactly what happened last night as these concerns were met and dealt with as the cardinal red and gold rallied from a 2-0 deficit to defeat a tough Smith Barney club 6-2.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Accomplishing the team's most important victory of the year didn't come easy.  It required yet another sterling pitching performance by Bullet Bob Kostulias, timely hitting by the likes of Mike Coen and clutch fielding by a Dan Euerle to get the job done and initially it didn't look good with Barney taking an early 2-0 lead in the bottom half of the third inning on the strength of two singles and a dropped fly ball that led to these runs which of course were unearned.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Smith Barney held this lead through the 6th inning - at this point team Falcon had managed only 2 hits and things weren't looking good - "I was real concerned, I was well aware of the importance of the game - that we needed to win to stay alive" stated manager Mike after the game and all of a sudden the Falcons started to stir, scoring 2 big runs in the 6th as Dan Euerle singled,  Mike Casserly walked, Bob Kostulias reached on an infield single to load the bases, Adam Bloom hit a sac fly scoring Dan and Pat Casserly singled home brother Mike.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Now suddenly the Falcons are acting feisty, beginning to find themselves and so in the top of the 7th - Aaron Scheid and Keith Stanick singled, Eric Sandurs worked a walk to once again load the bases and all three scored on Mike Coen's booming triple to right and later scored himself on Dan Euerle's single. The Barney Boys then went down rather easily in the bottom of the inning and the victory belonged to the Falcons.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>...Victory gave the Falcons a 6-4 record for the season which means that since a number of teams in Division 2 have similar records - 3 of the 4 playoff spots are up for grabs - (Max Capital has a stranglehold on 1st Place with a 9-2 record). "We must win the remaining 2 games Aug. 21st and 22nd against Flushing Toilets and especially Los Guapos" stated MGR Casserly on the jubilant Falcon bench - there is also a possibility of a 13th game to decide playoff position - ask Kostulias about it an he seems to have the bigger picture with the focus of a math major - which is possibly a first for the Flash who now may be interested in becoming an Actuary...Speaking of the Bullet he did turn in another fab mound performance allowing 11 hits and those 2 unearned runs...The hitting hero of the night was Mike Coen ripping that clutch 3 run triple that turned the tide - after the game, while receiving congrats on the hit, Mike forcefully stated: "From now on address me a 'Winfield'"...A concern has been raised about Adam Bloom - as the team was leaving the field it was noticed how nervous Adam was acting - eyes darting, a twitch in his upper lip - sweating mightily - "I've got those DT's again - yeah I admit it - I'm addicted to sunflower seeds and I didn't bring any - my dad Mr. Bloom hid them - I need my seeds - Now!" - Easy big guy - you'll get yours soon...Don't forget we have games on 8/21 against the Flushing Toilets and 8/22 against Los Guapos and we'll accept nothing short of complete victory!</p>
