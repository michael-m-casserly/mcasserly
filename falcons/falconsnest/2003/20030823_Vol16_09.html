<p class="FalconsNestText">Another night, another important game, a game that the Falcons needed to win to remain in the playoff hunt and what better diamond to play this game on then good old diamond 11, North Meadow, the scene of many of the team's greatest victories including 3 championships. So on a hot, steamy night with a threat of thunder storms in the air, the Falcons rose to the history the club has with the field and came away with yet another clutch victory defeating an outgunned Los Guapos team 12-3.  The W gives team Falcon a strong chance to participate in the upcoming playoffs slated to begin in all likelihood after Labor Day.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Given the starting time of 7:00, the Falcons realized the importance of getting off to a good start and that happened in the top of the first.  A leadoff single by Pat Casserly, William Mills reached on an error, a run producing single from Bob Rupe, a big 3 run home run from Aaron Scheid and Keith Stanick made it back to back with his first homer of the year and the score is 5-0 Falcons.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons then kept adding to that early lead in the top of the 2nd, Dan Euerle singled to third and Mike Casserly whacked a home run to left-center to make things 7-0. Now we're in the 3rd inning and the Falcons want more, so Bob R reaches on an 'E6', consecutive singles by Scheid, Stanick, and Eric Sandurs, the latter driving in 2 and after 2 were out, Greg Rivera delivered a 2 run opposite field double to make the lead 11-0.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Los Guapos came up with 3 runs of their own in the bottom of the 3rd on the strength of a 3 run home run and the Falcons added one more run in the fading light as Vernon Chin drove in Eric Sandurs for run No. 12 in the 5th and the game ended at the end of 5 with very little light left and the final score of 12-3.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>...The victory gave the Falcons a final regular season record of 8-4 which included a forfeit win, over the Flushing Toilets on 8/21 - The Falcons and the 5 members of the Toilets team hung around long enough to play a "practice" game which probably helped the Falcons to stay sharp for the Los Guapos game...It's important to note that since several teams are vying for 3 of the 4 playoff spots, possibly there will have to be played a so called '13th Game' to decide playoff eligibility - this game could be played towards the end of the week - more on that later...Playing on diamond 11, formerly known as "Falcon Field" (when we were home) brought back a flood of memories for Ex-MGR Mills and the Falcon Fan - the highs of championships, the clutch wins, the plays, the battles with a variety of arch rivals that stretched from interdepartmental softball to two different company leagues.  It will never be forgotten - ever (sob)…Meanwhile the modern day Falcons had a blast like Aaron Scheid (homer, 3 RBIs), Keith Stanick (homer, 3 hits), Greg Rivera (2 run double), Mike Casserly's 2 run homer and the beat goes on...By the way any scoring decision change after consultation with MGR Mike - Players involved will be notified…Speaking of notification watch those emails and/or phone calls for our next game (we hope)...</p>
