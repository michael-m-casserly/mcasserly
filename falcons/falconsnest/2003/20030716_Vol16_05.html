<p class="FalconsNestText"> It was a beautiful night at Diamond 1 North Meadow to play softball and it resulted in an equally beautiful game won by the Falcons against an outclassed Axadent team by the score of 16-0.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons as the visiting team once again did most of the damage in the top of the first as Mike McGuigan reached on an error, Aaron Scheid lined a single to right and the hot hitting Bob Rupe tripled both runners home for the early 2-0 lead. Keith Stanick then worked a walk, Eric Sandurs drove home Rupe on a single to left, Scott Miller reached on an error followed by run producing singles from Dan Eurele and Mike Casserly and with the bases loaded, Bob Kostulias walked to score a run, Mike McGuigan up for the second time in the inning lined a single for a run and Aaron Scheid cleaned the bases with a 2 run triple-that sounds like 10 runs!</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"> The Falcons picked up 3 more runs in the 2nd inning on consecutive singles from Chris Paper and Scott Miller who then scored as Dan Euerle reached on an error and while the ball was being bobbled around, Dan advanced to 3rd base and eventually scored himself on Mike Casserly’s single to right field. Runs 14 and 15 were scored in the 3rd as Bob Rupe opened with his second triple scoring on Keith’s triple and Keith scored on Eric Sandurs’ second run producing single of the night.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Alrighty then- one more run for the Falcons in the 4th inning: with Mike Casserly on base via a leadoff single, scored run no.16 after a single from Bullet Bob and a fielder’s choice involving Mike McGuigan. The Axadents launched a mild threat in the bottom of the inning, but a pop to third and a 6-3 ground out ended the threat and with the mercy rule invoked, so did the game.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes...</i>The Falcons’ Mysterious Managing Partner made his first appearance of the year; arriving in his chauffeured limo, the MGP changed clothes with his driver to disguise himself as the chauffeur and watched the Falcons romp and then gave this warning: “just because we had a cakewalk tonight doesn’t mean we should relax. This division is tough and nothing should be taken for granted. For example I noticed some of our stars like Mills, Bloom, Rivera, Vernon, etc. were M.I.A.-we’ll need them all in order to advance to the playoffs so everyone stay focused” and with that the MGP switched back to his expensive blue blazer/grey slacks combo, climbed into the back of his cardinal red stretch limo and commanded his driver; “home Lurch”….Many hitting heroes like Aaron Scheid(3 hits,2 ribbies), Bob Rupe’s 2 triples, 2 hits and 2 ribbies off the bat of Eric Sandurs and Manager Mike’s 3 hits and 2 rbi’s and the hitting beat goes on….a 25th anniversary memory from the Falcon Fan: “we’re battling a team called the Skull for the 1989 Interdepartmental Softball Championship. We get blasted in game 4 by the score of 26-7 with some of our best players like Dave “The Phantom” Caulfield (he went to the Notre Dame game at Giants Stadium instead) missing in action. I get hold of a couple of our boys like Founding Father Ken Simeone who’s in Florida. He comes home the day that game 5 is to be played, gets my message and with everyone else including The Phantom helps us win our first championship!....The next 2 games on 7/25 and 7/28 will be critical to any future success-so all you VIP guys: hope you’ll be there!</p>
