<p class="FalconsNestText"> It was a return match from last year’s championship game and this time, a feisty, no holds barred Maximum Capital club prevailed with a come from behind victory over the Falcons at Diamond 4 on the Great Lawn Friday night to the tune of 12-8.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons drew first blood on base hits from Adam Bloom, Aaron Scheid and Keith Stanick which included some solid hustle on the bases to score 2 runs. Max Capital tied it in the top of the 2nd when their first two runners reached on throwing errors followed by two run producing singles and these runs were unearned.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The score became 5-2 Falcons in the 3rd inning on the basis of 4 singles, a fielder’s choice and a sac fly by Keith. The Capital team closed to 5-4 in their half of the 4th inning in similar fashion with 4 singles and a sac fly, but the Falcons pulled ahead to 8-4 on 2 runs scored in the bottom of the 4th on consecutive singles from Greg Rivera, Pat Casserly and Dan Euerle’s 2 run hit and added run no. 8 in the next inning as Adam Bloom doubled and Bob Rupe singled home Adam.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So the stage was now set for what turned out to be a big time comeback for Max Capital. The 6th inning saw them hit two solo homeruns, a single, a fielder’s choice, another single and a 2 run triple to tie the score at 8. Max Capital then took the lead in the 7th scoring 4 runs which featured 2 singles, a sac fly, a double and yet another 2 run homerun to left center field. The Falcons then went down 1-2-3 in the bottom of the inning for the final score of 12-8</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes...</i>Despite the loss, the Falcons managed 14 hits, unfortunately only 1 hit was for extra bases, but there was some opportunistic base running hustling an extra base from the likes of Adam Bloom(2 hits, 3 runs scored), Aaron Scheid(2 hits,2 runs scored, ribbie) and a clutch 2 run hit from Dan Eurele looking to break out of a hitting slump….Bob Kostulias was rocked hard in the final 2 innings(3 homers) and lamented that he didn’t make adjustments to his pitching serves after the first 2 homeruns, but vows to be improved in the future….Game was marred when in an attempt to reach base on what turned out to be a 7th inning ending double play, Max Capital’s resident loon “Rocky” attempted to knock the ball out of Bob Rupe’s glove, slid into the base and Bob almost leading to a bench clearing brawl, not cool at all especially since the league frowns on such incidents. Of course The Rock’s posturing is partially an act, but the act has gotten old much like Rocky himself-so enough already! ....Next game will take place on 7/15 against the Axadents. See you at the park.</p>
