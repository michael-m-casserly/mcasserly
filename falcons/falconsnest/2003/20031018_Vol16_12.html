<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons came to dampish Dewitt Clinton Complex with high expectations of winning and moving to the championship game but those hopes were dashed as the Falcons were defeated by their arch rivals the Panthers 13-3 on a night that the Falcons chose to play their worst game of the season.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">"We were outplayed in every phase of the game but certainly not outclassed" lamented Manager Casserly immediately after the conclusion of this no contest. The Falcons actually started off well scoring 2 in the top of the first as Pat Casserly reached on an E6 followed by consecutive singles from William Mills, Bob Rupe and Aaron Scheid. The Panthers then followed a tried and true formula they've used in the last 2 games played against the Falcons scoring 5 runs on the basis of 4 hits and a double, the second of these was a throwing error from the outfield for the early 5-2 lead in the bottom of the first inning. </p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Panthers continued the scoring in the 2nd inning picking up 5 runs with key hits coming on a 2 run double and a run producing triple among other hits. Now just like that the Falcons found themselves in a 10-2 hole and also found it difficult to mount any kind of a decent rally stranding runners in each of the remaining 5 innings and 9 overall. The Panthers then put the game on ice by picking up 3 more runs in the 4th on a double, an error and a 3 run homer that really was the result of a misplayed fly ball.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons managed just one more run in the 7th as Aaron Scheid scored on Vernon Chin's sac fly after Aaron had singled and advanced to third on an E4 which ended the scoring at 13-3. So the Falcons' story for 2003 ends on a low note so unfortunately its "wait till next year" time.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>...The hitting wasn't much with Pat Casserly picking up 2 hits and the same for Aaron Scheid with Bob Rupe and Vernon Chin driving in a run each...Pitcher Bob Kostulias had some trouble in the 3 playoff games pitching inconsistently but The Bullet vows to do better in 2004 by learning to vary his pitching patterns to different hitters in different situations, to be more "scientific" like his predecessor Steve Grimsley...The Falcons' Mysterious Managing General Partner pretending to be a dog sitter at the nearby dog run checked out the game and with his eyes burning intensely, saw the Falcons go practically belly up and has vowed "to get it done next year" and to help things along has scheduled some organizational meetings which could include setting up a scouting system assigning Bullet Bob to launch it. "Bob has the insight and the right amount of guile plus the ability to hide in plain sight that allows him to make a book on opposing teams, all he'll need is a clipboard to complete the look" stated the Big Guy. So with a couple of Beagles, a German Shepherd and a Golden Lab nipping at his heels, the MGP jumped into his mini Hummer and drove off into the rainy night to return to his estate located in Neptune, N.J. …News of the Falcons’ loss was not well received by veteran Falcons like Dan King who started shouting at no one in particular, Dave Panasik immediately began running his fingers through his mullet, Dave Caulfield started cursing in Latin, Steve Grimsley fishing for blues off Montauk and upon hearing about the loss threw "the biggest blue I've ever caught" back into the ocean and Miquel Rivera who wants to return in 2004 to help the Falcons win a League Title...Seriously this year was mostly fun, we struggled at times and had to turn ourselves into the rally kids at the end to get into the playoffs and beyond so hopefully the Falcons will remain intact adding new players as needed and make a run for League Title No. 5 in 2004!</p>
