<p class="FalconsNestText">On a Friday the 13th night fit only for ducks, the Falcons blasted an outgunned Flushing Toilets team by the score of 16-2 at rain soaked Diamond 4 on the Great Lawn  combining  power hitting, solid defense and shut the door pitching to get the job done.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The scoring deluge started immediately in the bottom of the first on 4 consecutive hits by the top of the order including Bloom, Hernandez, Scheid and the highlight of the sequence, a big homerun by Bob Rupe. Two more runs were added on consecutive triples by Eric Sandurs and Mike Coen and consecutive singles by newcomer R.J. Filipski and Pat Casserly. So the score is 6-0, the weather is getting worse by the minute and so in the 2nd inning, the Falcons reached for the mercy rule by having one of the teams’ best ever innings by scoring 9 runs which featured another 2 run homerun to left field by Bob Rupe and a 2 run homerun bomb by Pat Casserly to make the game 15-0. Now the of course the idea is to get in enough innings to make the game official, so Pitcher Bullet Bob threw some hittable pitches and the result was 2 runs scored highlighted by 2 consecutive run producing doubles.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons picked up one run in the top of the 3rd when Adam Bloom on base after a single and then moving to second base after an infield single hit by Aaron Scheid came home on Bob Rupe’s double to right center. The two teams slogged through another couple innings and finally, mercifully the umpire said after the top of the 5th-“no mas” and the game was in the books for the Falcons’ second win of this still young season.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes...</i>With the exceptions of Dan Eurele, Mike Casserly and Bob Kostulias, everyone else had great nights at the plate like Adam Bloom and Aaron Scheid’s 3 hits each, Mike Coen’s 3 ribbies resulting from 3 hits, a couple of rbi’s from R.J. Filipski and without question the hitting star of the night was Bob Rupe with 2 homers and a double that produced 6 runs batted in- “it was worth cutting my new job to feel the joy of a big night at the plate, after all jobs are a dime a dozen, but there’s only one Falcons softball team”!- brings tears to your eyes doesn’t it?....weather and field conditions were not conducive to playing ball- muddy, slippery conditions and on and off rain made for a miserable night and if you think about it, game probably should have been postponed….speaking of postponements, the game of 5/27 should have been played, but wasn’t due to a misunderstanding with the league. Unfortunately Greg Rivera and the Falcon Fan were not reached in time with the news and with our opponent and the umpire on site, things looked ripe for a forfeit. With both gents bewildered and pissed about coming to the park for nothing, decided to trash the place while leaving, kicking over trash baskets, brushing aside people, jumping turnstiles, aw-you know the drill…. remember the next game is 6/17 and the next game after that is 6/27 vs. Maximum Capital.</p>
