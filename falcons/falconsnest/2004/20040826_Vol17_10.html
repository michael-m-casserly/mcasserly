<p class="FalconsNestText">Needing a win in the playoff hunt, especially after a bad loss to the Nomads, the Falcons found a hitting groove combined with hustle and good pitching and put away Los Guapos 12-3 at Diamond 1 North Meadow Wednesday night.  The win raised the team's season record to 6 and 4.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons started the scoring right off the bat with leadoff singles from Shaun Follo and Scott Miller who were driven in on a single by Vernon Chin.  Los Guapos struck back in their half of the first scoring 2 for the tie score.  The Falcons didn't like tie scores so they decided to break it by plating 4 runs in the 2nd on the strength of RJ Filipski's hustling triple who then broke that tie scoring on a 5-3 which was followed by a Dan Eurele home run blast to right and after 2 more singles, Scott Miller drove in both with a 2 out single to left center.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So now the Falcons are winning comfortably 6-2 and eventually 6-3 after Los Guapos had picked up a run in the bottom of the third and somebody said "We want more." So after 2 out walks were issued and Shaun Follo had singled to load the bases, that man Scott Miller drove in 2 more runs to make things 8-2.  After a Los Guapos run in the 5th, the Falcons completed the scoring picking up 4 big runs in the top of the 6th: A leadoff walk to Eric Sandurs followed by 1 out singles from Mike Casserly and Bob Kostulias.  A sac fly from Shaun Follo, Scott Miller's 4th hit of the night to load the bases and a bases clearing triple by Bob Rupe to make the game 12-3.  With the clock running to 7pm, the contest ended after 6 innings with the 12-3 score as a final.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons put on a  real hitting show with many heroes like Shaun Follo, (3 hits, 2 runs, Ribbie), 4 runs, 4 RBI's from Scott Miller, Bob Rupe's 3 run triple, Vernon Chin's 2 RBI's, RJ Filipski with his hustling out a triple as he alertly watched the slowness of the Los Guapos outfield to take 3rd base, Dan Euerle and his first home run of the season, 2 runs scored by Mike Casserly and finally - Thank God because I'm tired of his whining - Bob Kostulias breaking through with 2 hits and his various beards scoring 3 runs!  After the first hit, the Bullet broke into a funky dance - we'll call it the Bob Kostulias Stomp, to celebrate his feat.  Early in the game, Vernon Chin on the bench as the teams DH alerted the Falcons' scorekeeper that he - Vernon- had spotted a Falcon flying around.  Both men regarded this sighting as a good omen for the eventual victory and when the Falcons' mysterious MGP heard about it, he immediately ordered his assistants to buy a "flock of falcons" and train them to fly over Falcons games to bring good luck to the team.  But also, to dive bomb and peck away at the opposition to annoy and distract…. Pat Casserly, still day to day with his cut, should be ready to go by next week - that according to the Falcons geriatric trainer, Izzy Mendelbaum, who will personally take out Pat's stitches unless Izzy's back gives out…. Next week is big - we play 2 games on 8/30 and 9/1 - win both and the Falcons should make the playoffs - anything else - See you next year!</p>
