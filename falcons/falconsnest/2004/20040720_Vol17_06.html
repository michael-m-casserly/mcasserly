<p class="FalconsNestText">A whale of a slow pitch softball game was played at Diamond 1 North Meadow last night as the Falcons out toughed a very good, very tough team themselves, the previously undefeated Lookouts as pitcher Bob Kostulias fashioned a 4 hit 1-0 shutout combined with super defense and clutch hitting to nail down the victory.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">What's important to note hear is the fact that the Falcons got it done with a somewhat makeshift lineup with a couple of big bats missing. "When I arrived at the park accompanied by the can do man at 6:40 I saw only 6 guys available for play and I was nervous about it - that maybe we may be looking at a forfeit" said a jubilant manager Mike after the game. "But then Aaron came for 8 players and finally around 7:10 the Bullet made it for a starting 9 against their 11."</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The game itself was a tightly played affair on both sides as the two teams felt each other out trading pitching effort against pitching effort and displaying strong fielding with the Lookouts showing off their fabled inner D and Bullet Bob inducing several popups and routine flyouts (11 in all) combining with 10 groundouts and forces to keep the dangerous Lookout lineup at bay. For example in the bottom of the 5th, the No. 5 hitter for the Lookouts hit a hard liner to Bob K who juggled, covered and threw to first for the 1-3. This was an important out because the next batter managed to hit a fly ball over Pat Casserly's outstretched glove for a triple but the next batter routinely flied out to Eric Sandurs for out no. 3 to end the threat.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">It finally came down to the 7th Inning and the Falcons got the job done as Aaron Scheid singled and hustled to 2nd when the fielder bobbled the ball. After RJ Filipski reached on an error, Shaun Follo ripped a single to right center scoring Aaron for the 1-0 lead but the Falcons scored no more and in the bottom of the 7th, the Lookouts put on a mild rally placing 2 runners on base resulting from a single and a throwing error but Bob K induced a ground ball for the 6-4 force to end things giving the Falcons the W.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The 1-0 loss broke the Lookouts, 20 straight regular season wins over 2 years in the league (their only loss was in last year's Championship Game)-the Falcons meanwhile playing in only the team's 6th game and after a layoff of 4 and a half weeks played their best game defensively of the year with heady, alert play combined with the strong pitching in a game that reminded one of a well played baseball game...The hitting heroes were of course Aaron Scheid and his "double" and Shaun Follo's clutch single driving in Aaron for the big run...A couple of biggies were MIA like Keith Stanick, Bob Rupe, Scott Miller, Vernon Chin, William Mills, Mike Coen, and founding father Ken Simeone out with a sore foot-seems like the FF was thumbing through Clinton's wordy 1000 page "My Life-Ain't I the Greatest" at Barnes and Noble when he dropped it on his foot-probably will have to be placed on the 60-month DL...The 4-2 Falcons next official game is Aug. 6th vs. Max Capital but watch out for possible rescheduled games by the league before 8/6!</p>
