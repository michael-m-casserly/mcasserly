<p class="FalconsNestText">This was it - it all came down to one game to pretty much decide whether or not the Falcons would be able to advance to the playoffs… and so they did, by defeating the High Rollers (Saks 5th Avenue), at Diamond 5 in the North Meadow, last night by the score of 4-2.  This, like I wrote in the last issue, means the Falcons enter the playoffs for the 19th time since 1984.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The High Rollers opened the scoring by picking up a run in the top of the first on the strength of 3 singles for the early 1-0 lead.  The Falcons picked up a run themselves in the bottom of the 2nd as Pat Casserly led off with a single, advanced to third on a single and a fly-out and scored on a fielder's choice by Dan Euerle.  The Falcons then moved ahead 2-1 in the bottom of the 5th on lead off singles by Dan Euerle and Mike Casserly.  Bob Kostulias then reached on an error and Dan eventually scored the unearned run as Scott Miller also reached on the E5.  This was after Mike Casserly, who had advanced, got thrown out by the shortstop who had made a play on Shaun Follo - shortstop to home for the inning's 2nd out.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The High Rollers hung in there, tying the game, picking up a run on three singles in the 6th.  Now, the score is 2-2, the light is beginning to fade, the season is on the line, the pressure is on and team Falcon responded in the bottom of the 6th scoring 2 big runs to move ahead 4-2!  Keith Stanick led off with a walk and after a fly out, Pat Casserly reached on an E4.  RJ Weaver flied out for out No. 2, and up stepped Justin Picciano, who delivered a clutch double scoring Keith to give the Falcons the lead and Dan Euerle drove in the insurance run singling home Pat Casserly from third base.  The High Rollers then went down 1-2-3 in the top of the 7th and the Falcons find themselves in yet another playoff.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--It's also possible that the Falcons could have gotten into the playoffs with 7 wins or even if last nights game had ended in a tie - this according to the Falcons' Director of Misinformation, Bob Kostulias, who wasn't sure of anything.  But then, neither was the league.  So, the win was important because it clinched 3rd place in the standings, thereby guaranteeing our spot in the upcoming playoffs.  Our opponent in the first round will be The Daddee… The hitting once again was just OK - 10 hits with 10 runners stranded.  With Justin Picciano (double to score go ahead run) and Dan Euerle (singling in the insurance run) as the hitting heroes… For the second game in a row, one of the Falcons mascots showed, and that would be Rocky the Bulldog, who's turning into the Falcons' lucky rabbit's foot, despite his snorting and drooling, the Rock enjoys watching the give and take of the games- like any good dog… News from Adam Bloom: He and the Mrs. Have arrived at the North Pole, where in howling winds and minus 50 degrees, he declared "I think I've found my spiritual MOJO." Teeth chattering "Now let's get the hell out before we freeze our asses off!"… Injury Department: Bob Rupe fell on his hand, tripping over a runner, "I can't close it, otherwise it's good.  Dan Euerle hurt his groin, "I can't breath, otherwise I'm good to go."  Good to go means the playoffs will start in about 10 days, so watch those e-mails for where and when.</p>
