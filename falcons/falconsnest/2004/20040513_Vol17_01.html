<p class="FalconsNestText">It was déjà vu all over again as Maximum Capital edged out the Falcons 3-2 at Breezy Diamond 4 North Meadow just like they did on 7/25/03 when they won 2-1 in extra innings.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The score just like the last game that had these teams clashing was indicative of very good pitching and good defense although the edge went to Max Capital and ultimately was the difference in the game.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The first inning saw the clubs exchange 2 runs each - in the top of the 1st after a lead off walk and a fielder's choice, Max. Cap's hitting star "Rocky Jr." smacked a double to left for a run and later scored on an infield error for the 2-0 lead.  The Falcons answered back in the bottom of the inning as Bob Rupe drilled a 2 out single to left, Keith Stanick dumped a single to left center and after Aaron Scheid reached on an error to load the bases, Greg Rivera drove in 2 with a solid single to right center to tie the score.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons' waterloo came in the 4th inning when Rocky Jr. led off with a single, the no. 4 hitter reached on an E4 on what could have been the back end of a double play and this runner then scored from 2nd base on another infield error.  The other big play in this sequence came when this runner tried to score from 2nd base but was thrown out at the plate on a single - Pat Casserly to catcher Scott Miller for the sweeping tag.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons rallied a bit in the bottom of the inning loading the bases on the strength of 3 singles and a fielder's choice but Eric Sandurs popped to short and Pat Casserly hit into a force to end the inning.  While Maximum Cap threatened a couple of times in the 6th and 7th innings, there was no more scoring and the final score of 3-2 Maximum Capital became official.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>...The Falcons managed just 10 hits with Greg Rivera the hitting star with the big 2 out 2 ribbie single - Keith Stanick also chipped in with 3 hits but that was all she wrote...interesting trend seems to be starting as pitcher Bob Kastulias who actually can't help himself has inspired Alberto Hernandez and Eric Sandurs to go with the shaved head look making them all look like actor Peter Boyle - Like I always say: "Holy Crap!"...Aside to Bob Rupe - don't feel bad about the championship rings - maybe later - maybe a benefactor will come through with some dough to pay for them - but then again maybe not... After the game, on the B train Bullet Bob was going over the game  - with his eyes rolling back in his head kept saying "Serenity now, serenity now!!"  Followed by "Hoochie Mama" - when he came to his senses The Flash began to fantasize about the time when 20 year old Jose Reyes with the 40 year hamstring will play and hit behind the Kaz guy on a regular basis - dream on dude... A couple of big time Falcons were missing in action like legendary former manager William Mills who got straight jacketed into working late in his trophy strewn hole in the wall office - staring dreamingly at the trophies, William couldn't help but feel the emotions of not being able to "be with my team in it's time of need and believe it - the Falcons are still my team."... Speaking of trophies, once the 2003 MVP Awards are announced (should be anytime now), trophies will be purchased and hopefully all the recent trophies won by the team will be shown to all the Falcons in a bar setting.  Especially important is the 2002 Championship trophy currently being held by Vernon Chin who dusts it lovingly every afternoon just before he leaves the office... One more item about the MVP trophies - I'm 
looking to collect more money for the 2 trophies from the rest of you or most of the rest of you - about $3 each will get it done - bring it to the next game on May 26th - Game is scheduled at 7pm...The Falcons Mysterious General Partner announced through his PR guy Jackie Chiles some organizational changes - Ken Simeone is now a figure head executive vice president, William Mills Executive Vice President - Policy Dept. the Falcons "Can Do Man" will now be a Vice President/Administration Performing General Manager and will now be senior score keeper and hopefully will be assigned a junior scorekeeper (TBA) and will continue to write and edit the Falcons' Nest perhaps in scaled down form and the MGP also announced that Hall of Famer Dan King to be VP in charge of scouting with Eric Sandurs and Bullet Bob as his Birddogs - First assignment for Dan: A trip to Japan to check out the available talent - so Dan get your kimono ready for action - you go to Tokyo on the 4am flight out of JFK on Monday...Our next game in May 26th - 7pm - Diamond 4 North Meadow against a brand new team called Meister Schmeister or something like that - See you all there at 7!</p>
