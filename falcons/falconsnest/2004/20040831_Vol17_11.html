<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons in a must win situation to gain a playoff berth pulled off a tough, gritty victory over the pesky Moonlight Grahams team 6-4 at humid Diamond 1, North Meadow Monday night.  The W ran the Falcons record for the season to 7 and 4 and one more win on Wednesday and team Falcon will definitely make the playoffs for the 19th time since 1984.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The game itself could be classified as the early part and the later part.  Early on, both teams were feeling each other out with the Grahams threatening first in the top of the 3rd starting with singles from the first 2 batters.  But the third hitter in the inning hit into a 6-5 force and batter 4 grounded into an unusual 4-5-3 double play.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Finally, the Falcons broke through with a run in the bottom of the 4th as Bob Rupe on base with a single, scored on RJ Filipski's Ribbie single to right center.  Two more Falcons runs crossed the plate in the bottom of the 5th when after the Falcons loaded the bases on singles from Mike Casserly and Bob Kostulias and Shaun Follo reaching on an error, Bob Rupe drove in a run on a sac fly and Keith Stanick drove in a run singling home designated runner Dan Euerle for the 3-0 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Now it's the latter part of the game and I wouldn't want to overlook what happened in the top of the 5th.  With the score 1-0 and 1 out, the Grahams' second batter of the inning singled, another hit followed, but when the next hitter hit a grounder to short, the runner stationed at third base attempted to score and was thrown out at the plate on a 6-2 force.  The 5th hitter to bat then singled to left, but the runner at 2nd base attempted to score but was thrown out on a 7-6-2 to end the inning with no runs scored a very important play as we'll see later because after the Graham's broke through with a run in the 6th, a walk to RJ Weaver, another one to Pat Casserly, singles from Dan Euerle and Mike Casserly. Bob Kostulias reached on an error and Shaun Follo's sac fly helped to drive in the runs, good thing because the Grahams staged a 3 run rally in the top of the 7th on the strength of 5 singles and a throwing error, but then the Falcons buckled down and ended the game in the twilight on a pop to Dan Euerle.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons made OK use of their 14 hits, scoring 6 runs, but the season long problem of stranding runners continues as 10 runners were LOB.  Since the game with Daddee, the Falcons have left 38 runners on base - not a good percentage… still there was some clutch hitting:  Like RJ Filipski driving in Bob Rupe for the early lead, a sac fly from Bob Rupe for a run, a ribbie single from Keith Stanick, ribbie singles from Dan Euerle and Mike Casserly, followed by Shaun Follo's sac fly to pick up those 3 runs that iced the victory...Looks like we need to win on Wednesday night vs. the High Rollers to get into the playoffs.  If we get into the playoffs, we'll need all of our A-list players to be available, plus our deep roster to give us a fighting chance to advance to a championship series.</p>
