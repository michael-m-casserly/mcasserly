<p class="FalconsNestText">It was only the fourth game of the season, yet last night's game on a hot humid night at Diamond 1 North Meadow was the most important game for the Falcons of this still young season. A loss would give the team a 1 win and 3 loss record and possibly an uphill climb for the rest of the year against some tough opponents-A win evens the record at 2 and 2 keeping the Falcons in the playoff hunt.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Mindful of this gave the Falcons a sense of urgency and so Adam Bloom led off the game with a walk, Pat Casserly doubled Adam to third, the hot hitting Bob Rupe doubled home 2 runs and later scored on Vernon Chin's single up the middle. High Rollers picked up 2 runs in their half of the first and then added a run in the second and so with the score tied at 3, the Falcons opened up a big lead picking up 9 runs in the third, leadoff walks to Bob K and Bloom, Pat Casserly's single, and an error allowing Bob R to reach, after a flyout Aaron Scheid reached when the right fielder dropped a fly ball, Vernon singled in a run, RJ Filipski reached on a fielder's choice, Justin Picciano walked, Eric Sandurs drove in 2 with a single moving to second base on an outfield error, Mike Casserly drove in 2 more with a double, Bob K walked for the second time in the inning but finally the inning ended on a flyout. But the result was a 12-3 lead. The teams exchanged runs in the fourth and so with a 13-4 lead, the Falcons felt reasonably safe, but the night was still young and the High Rollers proved it scoring 7 runs in the fifth inning on a combination of ground ball singles, a couple of infield errors, hurried throws producing 2 more runs after 2 were out mostly on those hurry up throws to the wrong position and the score is 13-11.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Now it was a matter of holding on and the Falcons in combination with overanxious swinging by the High Rollers shut down the Rollers in the Final 2 Innings gaining that all important victory to even the Falcons record at 2 wins and 2 losses.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>-- The hitting remained strong with the lineup producing 15 hits resulting in the 13 runs-a big 4 hit night from Pat Casserly (3 runs scored), Bob Rupe's big 2-run double, 2 hits, 2 ribbies from the steady Vernon Chin, Eric Sandur's 2-run single and Mike Casserly's 2-run double-all key hits, clutch hits that made the difference in what turned out to be a tight scoring game...Falcons played pretty well defensively except for that fifth inning when 4 errors and careless throwing made it worse than it should have been...if the team wants to move forward and eventually make the playoffs in a tough division, everything-hitting, pitching, and fielding will have to gel at the same time to make a playoff berth happen…Prior to the start of the game, many of the players sat or stood around a large rock-this rock has a history-as printed in reading material put out by the Parks Dept. The Rock can be traced back to prehistoric times which leads to this bit of information and too all of you who did it, you'll be happy to know you were sitting on some fossilized dinosaur doodoo, hope you enjoyed it...Our next game is June 16th at 5:30 (How come?) vs. Los Guapos-Also look for yet another change in the schedule by checking in with Manager Mike on the Internet</p>
