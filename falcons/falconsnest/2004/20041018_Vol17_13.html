<p class="FalconsNestText">This edition of the Falcons' Nest (no.13) proved to be unlucky as the Falcons were eliminated from the playoffs losing to the Daddees 5-1 in a Division 2 semi-final contest played at the Harlem River Complex on Oct.5th.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The game itself was typical of the way the Falcons had played during the regular season with several scoring opportunities missed as the team stranded 9 runners which included just one extra base hit that turned out to be a triple slugged by Bob Rupe scoring Scott Miller who had reached as a result of a fielder's choice. Bob himself however was stranded as Keith Stanick grounded out to end the 4th inning.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">This score tied the game at that point since Daddee had picked up a run in the bottom of the third on a single and an RBI double by their leadoff hitter. After the top of the 4th, both pitchers matched serve for serve with the Falcons threatening in the top of the 5th on leadoff singles from Vernon Chin and Eric Sandurs, but both were left on base after a fielder's choice and two fly outs.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">This leads us to the fateful bottom of the 6th inning when Daddee broke through scoring 4 runs to take the lead. After a fly out, a single followed and the next batter reached on a throwing error, a walk came next then a came a fly ball for out no.2 followed by another critical error and finally a single resulting in 4 runs at least 3 being unearned. Again the Falcons threatened in the last chance to win in the top of the 7th with 2 out singles from Keith Stanick and that man Vernon Chin, but both were stranded as the final out was made by Eric Sandurs. So the season comes to an end with the loss and for the Falcons its "wait till next year"-again.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The hitting such as it was produced 9 hits with Vernon Chin reaching on 3 singles, Bob Rupe coming through with the triple scoring the lone Falcon run and Eric Sandurs chipping in with 2 hits but the problems of the hitting so prevalent during the season continued in this playoff game and along with the shaky D proved to be the Falcons undoing...The Falcons' Mysterious Managing Partner blending in with the area by wearing a bandana watched with disgust at the loss and after changing back to his expensive blue blazer and turtleneck stormed off in his limo muttering something about "shaking things up" as he traveled to Yankee Stadium for the Yankees/Twins game where he shared a luxury suite with his pals The Donald, Henry Kissinger and Jerry Seinfeld...The winds of change are beginning to swirl as Aaron Scheid has returned to the Left Coast, Founding Father Ken Simeone is thinking of retiring from active play due to a chronic pulled ab muscle and Bullet Bob waiting for his severance package. But no need to worry about The Bullet who's got a big time job lined up as a limo driver ferrying high rollers to AC. Hey Bullet – looking for a relief driver? Can-Do is available right now... So look everyone, stay loose and we'll try it again in '05.</p>
