<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons came to Diamond 6 North Meadow with a stated goal which was to maintain the momentum gained from the previous game, a victory over the High Rollers 13-11. Momentum would be important, a win here would give impetus to the Falcons for next week's battle action against 2 tough opponents "The Nomads" and the team regarded by some as the League's best-"The Lookouts"</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">And so the Falcons by defeating Los Guapos accomplished what they set out to do. Namely that the Falcons will be pretty tough themselves when it comes to crunch time. It showed in the fielding, the clutch hitting, hustle on the bases and strong pitching that made it an important win for the Falcon nation.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons opened the scoring in the bottom of the 2nd when with one out, consecutive singles from Winfield, Scott Miller, and RJ Filipski, a sac fly off the bat of the returning Shaun Follo and a 2-run single from Dan Euerle produced a 3-0 lead. The Falcons picked up a run in the 3rd on some base running hustle by Pat Casserly who after reaching on a fielder's choice scored after Bob Rupe singled and advanced on a poor throw from the outfield while Pat kept running to make it 4-0. A run was added in the 5th as Winfield picked up a hustling double and then scored on Scott Miller's double and an error by the third baseman allowing Scott to move to third base but unfortunately Scott was called out for interference when the umpire ruled that Scott impeded the vision of the fielder allowing the runner to score.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Meanwhile Los Guapos picked up their lone run on a double and a throwing error in the top of the 6th spoiling Bob's bid for a shutout, none the less-a win- 5-1 Final.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>-- Like I said-hitting, fielding, and pitching all coming together to make it happen-the hitting featured 13 hits, 3 hits from Bob Rupe who continues to amaze, a single and a double plus 2 runs scored from the mysterious Winfield, same deal from Scott Miller, Dan Euerle's 2 run double and a sac fly from Shaun Follo...The fielding-a terrific over the shoulder catch in the 5th Inning by Eric Sandurs, a stab of a liner by Adam Bloom in the 6th, hustling on backup plays and throws at first base by catcher Scott Miller, solid D from the likes of Pat Casserly, Shaun Follo, and Greg Rivera plus alert base running in general made life a lot easier for Bob Kostulias who fashioned a 5 hit, 1 run ball game in one of his best pitching performances who when speaking to the media after the game stated: "No distractions for me-forget about hawks, dogs or even the mysterious Managing General Partner's trained to spy on the Falcons Challenger the Eagle...I don't want some stinking eagle pecking at my head-all I cared about was focusing on home plate and mowing them down."...Injured list: Pat Casserly took one in the old jock strap trying to make a diving catch in the 4th inning-may have to be placed on the 7-day DL and don't forget, founding father Ken Simeone on the 60-month DL with a large comb stuck in the middle of his bushy hair...Apologies to scouting director Dan King for helping myself to a few envelopes-it was an emergency situation but remember Dan that you still are part of the Falcon Nation and therefore should be happy to "share and share alike"...Meanwhile your next scouting assignment is a trip to Belize, Good Luck Dan-O! And meanwhile the Falcons next game is next Tuesday, check with Manager Mike for further details for time and place...</p>
