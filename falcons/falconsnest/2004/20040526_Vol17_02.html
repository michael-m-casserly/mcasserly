<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons playing their second game of this young season (the 26th!) at chilly damp Diamond 5 North Meadow got their hitting and pitching act together and came away with an easy 8-1 victory over one of the Falcons' more prominent rivals Smith Barney Wednesday night. The victory evened the team's record at 1 and 1.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The scoring for the Falcons began immediately in the bottom of the first as Adam Bloom led off with a single followed by singles from Pat Casserly and Bob Rupe for 1 run, Aaron Scheid then reached on a fielder's choice and Vernon Chin delivered a RBI single scoring Pat and after RJ Filipski singled sending Aaron to third, Scott Miller's sac fly scored Aaron for the early 3-0 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Things were quiet for both teams especially with Bob Kostulias pitching and</u> fielding well, the latter coming into play when the Bullet stabbed a liner from Barney's leadoff hitter in the top of the 4th, until the bottom of the 5th when the Falcons picked up 5 more runs to ice the win. After Bob K struck out to start the inning and Adam Bloom tripled to right, Pat C. fouled out, there followed consecutive singles by Bob Rupe and Aaron Scheid, Vernon reached and consecutive singles from RJ, Scott and a 2 run single off the bat of Eric Sandurs made for the 8-0 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">As it turned out that's all the Falcons needed to win as Smith Barney couldn't produce any hitting to speak of and combined that with poor base running made things easy for the Falcons. However the Barney gang managed a run in the 7th on a single, a force and a triple and the final score became the aforementioned 8-1 Falcons.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>...There were a number of hitting stars like Adam Bloom (2 hits, 2 runs scored), 3 hits, 3 runs scored from Bob Rupe, 2 runs scored and excellent fielding from Pat Casserly, clutch hitting by Vernon Chin, a couple of hits from RJ Filipski, Scott Miller's sac fly and Eric Sandurs 2 ribbie single...Falcons continued their low level rivalry with Smith Barney, last year the two teams split 2 regular season games...Beg Pardon Dept: In the last Nest I said the Falcons had 8 hits, actually it was 10 hits vs. Max Capital's 9-I also stated in most copies of the Nest that Pat Casserly threw out a Max Cap runner on a relay involving Dan Euerle--however Pat threw the ball directly to Scott Miller for the tag play-Also I wrote that Ken Simeone was appointed figurehead executive VP actually its figurehead Executive VP Emeritus-- sorry about that…Looks like the Falcons have acquired another mascot dog when Adam Bloom's wife Kasia brought their pooch Bala (pronounced Baylor)- Bala is no Blackjack (Ken Skrastin's dog) but after some heavy training should be ready to attack the opposing team whenever they threaten to score or threaten the Falcons...The Falcons mysterious Managing General Partner sent in his pet hawk Omarosa to fly over the field with field with a miniature camera, the MGP was then able to see and enjoy the Falcons victory until Omarosa started killing off pigeons and field mice -- messy...Next Game vs. The Daddees on June 4th at 7pm...See you then!
