<p class="FalconsNestText">Something happened last night to the Falcons at Diamond 1 North Meadow in a very meaningful game they hoped to win to build momentum for a playoff berth.  Instead of a win, the Falcons took a tough loss as the hard hitting Nomads came from behind scoring 7 runs in the bottom of the 6th inning to pound out a 14-8 victory over the Falcons giving team Falcon a 5-4 record for the season.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Things started off OK as the Falcons jumped off to the early 3-0 lead as Adam Bloom led off with his customary walk followed by two singles from Shaun Follo and Bob Rupe that loaded the bases, setting up Keith Stanick's Sac fly to score Adam, moving Shaun to third who came home on Vernon Chin's single, moving Bob to third.  Bob then scored on Winfield's fielder's choice.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">From this point on the game became a back and forth affair with the Nomads scoring 2 in the bottom of the first and 2 more in the 2nd for the 4-3 lead.  But the Falcons tied it up in the third with a series of Nomad errors and misplays centering around a walk to Bob Kostulias and his pinch runner Mike Casserly.  But the Nomads moved ahead 5-4 in the bottom of the inning and the Falcons tied it at 5 in the top half of the 4th as Justin Picciano's 2 out single scored Keith Stanick who had led off the inning with a single of his own.  After an exchange of 2 runs each in the 5th inning, the Falcons pulled ahead 8-7 in the top of the 6th scoring a run without the benefit of a hit because of 3 Nomad errors for the 8-7 lead.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Now with daylight beginning to fade, the Nomads put the pedal to the metal and staged their big comeback in the bottom of the 6th, scoring 7 runs mostly on the strength of a bases clearing double and a 3 run homerun from the cleanup hitter.  Another unearned run was added later for the 14-8 lead and with the Falcons going down quietly in the top of the 7th the game ended in a Falcon defeat.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons mysterious managing general partner, watching the game from a specially constructed crow's nest located by the hand ball courts was not happy with the show and has called for a meeting with his inner circle at his sprawling estate in Neptune, NJ.  So founding father Ken Simeone, Manager Mike, ex-MGR William Mills, scouting director Dan King and the can-do man will trek down to the Jersey Shore to listen to the mysterious MGP's rants that echo throughout his entire estate through well placed loudspeakers…. Falcons managed just 10 hits to score the 8 runs aided and abetted by 7 Nomad errors.  But once again were unable to capitalize, stranding 12 runners in 7 innings while committing errors themselves resulting in 3 or 4 unearned runs.  Some of the leading batters include Adam Bloom (2 runs scored, triple) Shaun Follo (2 hits, Ribbie, 2 runs scored), Bob Rupe (run scored), Keith Stanick (2 hits, Sac fly), Vernon Chin's usual RBI and the mysterious Winfield's hustling run scored as the Nomads were throwing the ball around… Loss has thrown Adam Bloom for a loop, as a result Adam and the Mrs. Will be making a "spiritual journey" to the wilds of Alaska to find, as AB puts it, "To find my spiritual MOJO"… Adam, while doing that stop and say hi to my look alike cousin "Eskimo Joe" who runs a trading post near Fair Banks - He'll set you up with the dog sled you'll need as you inch your way up to the arctic circle… Injury Department: Pat Casserly currently day to day, cut his hand slicing some polish rye bread, needing stitches… After tonight (8/25) 2 more games next week - we need to win all 3 games to get into the playoffs!</p>
