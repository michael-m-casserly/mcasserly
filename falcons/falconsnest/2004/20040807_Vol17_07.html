<div id="FalconsNestContent">
<p class="FalconsNestText">Playing on a night without their ace pitcher, Bullet Bob Kostulias who was missing his first Falcon game in 2&#189; years because he was actually doing work  at his desk for the first time in 2&#189; years, the Falcons behind the pitching serves of sub pitcher Keith Stanick scored their second consecutive shutout taking down division rival Maximum Capital 6-0 at coolish Diamond 1 North Meadow last night.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons scored most of their runs early starting in the top of the first as Pat Casserly singled, moved to third on a force and scored on Keith Stanick's single to center. The second inning was the</u> inning for the Falcons-Alberto Hernandez reached on an infield single, moved to third on Dan Euerle's single to right and a misplay by the right fielder and both scored on Adam Bloom's booming home run over the right fielder's head.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">So now it's 4-0 Falcons and Maximum Capital has to try to figure out Keith's pitching and as hard as they tried ultimately they couldn't do it. For example in the fourth inning the Max managed to load the bases on three singles and a force but Keith bore down striking out the no. 5 hitter and inducing a pop-up to short to end the threat.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Now here's the deal: If you're a team leading a club like Max Capital by a 4-0 score and you're going into the 7th inning with that lead, wouldn't you want some insurance runs? Well of course you would and so the Falcons did just that picking up 2 runs as Pat Casserly and Bob Rupe scored on a sac fly by Keith Stanick and Greg Rivera's ribbie single for the now 6-0 lead. The bottom of the inning saw Keith get two quick outs, then issuing a walk and finally getting a ground ball for the 6-4 force-game over and the final score of 6-0 Falcons.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--As the game progressed, there appeared in the gray skies a colorful red and gold hot air balloon-you guessed it-The Falcons' Mysterious Managing General Partner came on the scene to check out the boys in action-as he expertly guided the balloon over the field, the MGP grabbed a bullhorn and blared encouragement to the guys down below yelling things like "Go get 'em Rupe", "Nice Play Danny Boy"-"Looking good Keith," etc. Finally the balloon caught an updraft and the MGP was swept up, up and away-currently the MGP is floating over Manchuria and when he finally comes down, the MGP will hopefully thumb a ride on the Trans-Siberian Express to get back to civilization...So did the man's encouraging calls help? Judge for yourself: Adam Bloom's 3 run dinger, Pat Casserly's 3 hits, 3 runs scored, Bob Rupe's 2 hits, a run scored, Keith Stanick's sac fly in the 7th inning and a run producing single from Greg Rivera must have made The Boss very happy...and how about Keith Stanick's chucking-mixing up his delivery from somewhat flat, to very flat to the occasional higher arc, Keith managed to keep the dangerous Max Capital lineup at bay all evening holding them to just 7 hits mixed in with some hard hit balls caught for outs by the alert Falcon D that also saw some sterling plays by the likes of Dan Euerle, Pat Casserly, and Shaun Follo...</p>
