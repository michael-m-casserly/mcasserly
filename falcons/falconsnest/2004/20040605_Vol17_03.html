<div id="FalconsNestContent">
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons returned to the scene of some of their greatest triumphs mixed with a couple of lowlights and unfortunately last night's contest against a new team in the league "The Daddee" was one of those aforementioned lowlights as Daddee pretty much ripped up the Falcons at Diamond 11 North Meadow using timely hitting and alert base running taking advantage of Falcon miscues to win 15-8.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Daddee built up the early lead scoring 2 in the bottom of the 1st aided and abetted by 2 Falcon errors on the infield and 2 more in the 3rd on a leadoff single, a fielder's choice, another single with an 'E3' in the sequence that moved the leadoff hitter to advance an extra base and finally a sac fly to score run no. 4 overall.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">But the Falcons bounced back nicely in the 4th on one-out consecutive singles from Rupe, Stanick, Filipski, Miller and that man of mystery known as "Winfield" and after a pop-out, Eric Sandurs delivered a run-producing single and Dan Euerle came through with a single scoring 2. And now the Falcons have a 5-4 lead only to see it tied at 5 as Daddee came up with a run on a double and a single and then broke it open with 5 runs in the 5th on the strength of 6 hits to make things 10-5. The Falcons managed to hang tough scoring 3 in the top of the 6th, a leadoff double by the hot-hitting Bob Rupe, a single from Keith Stanick, a sac fly from RJ Filipski, a single off the bat of Scott Miller and a 2 run single from Winfield who got thrown out in a run down, as the Daddee started throwing the ball around a bit encouraging the attempted advance.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">That sequence of scoring must have annoyed Daddee because in their half of the 6th they scored 5 more runs on 3 consecutive singles, a walk, a single and a double. With the score 15-8, the Falcons, after a leadoff single by Eric Sandurs went down 1-2-3 to end this game-Final Score 15-8 the Daddee.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--Normally when a softball team gets 16 hits scoring 8 runs - that kind of hitting merits a W, but not this time.  Leading batters included Bob Rupe (3 hits, 2 runs scored), Keith Stanick (2 hits, 2 runs scored), Scott Miller's 2 singles, ribbie and 2 runs scored, a couple of hits from Winfield + 2 hits from Eric Sandurs plus a ribbie and let's not forget that great relay 10-6-2 on the no. 5 Daddee hitter with catcher Scott Miller holding the ball to make the tag-just like a pro would do it…Missing in Action: Greg Rivera (job) and founding father Ken Simeone on the 60 month DL with a shattered oblique...Next Game is on June 9th -- Diamond 1 -- North Meadow at 7pm against High Rollers (Saks 5th Ave.)</p>
