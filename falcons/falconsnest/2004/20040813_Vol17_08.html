<div id="FalconsNestContent">
<p class="FalconsNestText">Playing in a rare early start, the Falcons saw their modest 3 game winning streak which included 2 consecutive shutouts snapped as they got dumped by the Daddees 5-2 last night at humid Diamond 4 North Meadow.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">Here's the oddity about this game - all the runs were scored in the first inning with only 6 hits earned by both teams the rest of the way!  The Daddees opened the scoring tallying 5 runs in the top of the first with pitcher Bob Kostulias reacquainting himself with the mound after missing the Falcons last game as he got reacquainted with his office desk.  His task of getting comfortable wasn't made easier as the Daddees lead off hitter reached on an Adam Bloom error.  The next two hitters singled for a run, two more singles followed for the 2-0 lead loading the bases and after an out the no. 7 hitter belted a double to left center to drive in 3 to make it 5-0.  But believe it or not, Bullet Bob settled down and then proceeded to retire 15 consecutive batters until a 1 out double in the top of the 6th!</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText">The Falcons then answered back in the bottom of the first as Adam Bloom led off with a walk, the first of three.  Eric Sandurs singled with 1 out, Keith Stanick walked to load the bases and Vernon Chin delivered a 2 run single to center  to make the score 5-2.  But after this scoring, the Falcons managed only 4 hits the rest of the way.  Although they tried real hard to catch up, stranding 10 runners from the 2nd inning on for 12 LOB's altogether.  So why didn't team Falcon score more runs?  Try the Daddee D featuring stabs of 2 line drives off the bat of Mike Casserly by the pitcher, a stab of a Greg Rivera line drive by the third baseman and a double play to end a scoring threat in the 2nd inning.  All of it added up to the final score of 5-2 - The Daddees.</p>
<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--Truthfully the best "hitting" of the night for the Falcons was the 3 walks worked by lead off hitter Adam Bloom showing off his storied batting eye and of course Vernon Chin's clutch 2 run single to get the Falcons on the score board - not that others didn't try like Shaun Follo with 2 hits, Eric Sandurs' single, run scored and a walk and Dan Euerle's 2 hits - But that was it for the hitting - Maybe Greg Rivera was right when he said afterwards that starting with a 1 ball, 1 strike count hurt the offense but of course with only an hour to play (there was a 7:00 game that followed our game) the shortened count became a necessity… After the game, Eric Sandurs moaned to the Falcons' General Manager / Scorekeeper about the error he committed in the first inning that helped set up the 2 run double to which the scorekeeper replied, "What error?  I didn't see any error."  To which Eric replied, "OK dude, whatever you say."… Falcon hitting continues to sputter.  For example, the team has hit only 1 home run all year and not that many extra base hits either.  So, in order to goose the hitting - where's Aaron Scheid, the mysterious "Winfield", William Mills, Scott Miller, et al.?  The schedule is at a critical stage.  You're needed for the push for a play off spot - of course we all know where the mysterious MGP is - he's arrived home after his hot air balloon crashed  in outer Mongolia and is now looking to handout those 2003 MVP awards and show off the '02 championship trophy.  Let's go for it and soon.  Falcons' next game are on 8/13 on Diamond 11 and a doubleheader on 8/24 that will help determine our chances for a playoff spot - so be there.</p>
