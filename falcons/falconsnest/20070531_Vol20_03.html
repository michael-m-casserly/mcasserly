<p class="FalconsNestText">Well, not exactly since Mel rallied for 4 runs in the 7th inning to close to 9-5, still it was another win for the Falcons, their 5th straight for the Falcons' best start since 1990.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Playing at a dusty Diamond 5, North Meadow, the Falcons bunched practically all of their scoring in two innings. The bottom of the first was big as Team Falcon picked up 4 runs: a walk to Greg Rivera, a single and after a single moving to second base on the throw from right center that put Mike Casserly on second base, Dan Euerle reached on an error, Keith Stanick delivered a 2-run single scoring Mike and Dan (Rivera had plated on the play involving Dan) and Bob Rupe drove in Keith from 2nd base (Keith moved to 2nd base on his hit) for the early 4-0 lead.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Meanwhile Mel was drawing blanks, unable to solve the pitching serves of Keith who basically forced Mel to hit into force plays to kill possible rallies until the 4th inning when the Mel dudes on a single, a fielder's choice, an infield error and a sac fly picked up a run. Then the Falcons struck back in the top of the 5th as new guy Chris Doria opened with a single, Greg singled, Manager Mike forced Chris, the Url Man reached on an error, Keith Stanick singled, advanced and eventually scored after Rupe was thrown out on a 1-3, but when the Mel first baseman attempted to throw out Keith who was looking to score, the catcher mishandled the throw and Keith scored run no. 4 in the inning. So let's sum up: Greg, Mike, Dan and Keith scored to make it 8-1. The Falcons then picked up one more in the 7th on consecutive doubles by Keith and cousin Bob to make the score 9-1.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText">Mel actually made things interesting in the bottom of the inning picking up 4 off a perhaps tiring Keith on 5 singles and a walk to make the final score of 9-5.</p>

<p class="FalconsNestText"><i>Falcon Flashes</i>--The Falcons picked up 14 hits to score the 9 runs with most of the damage done by the top of the order especially Keith Stanick (3 hits, 2 ribbies) and Bob Rupe also with 3 hits and 2 RBI's - Scott Miller was on base 3 times with walks and newcomers Mike Camarra and Chris Doria contributed with 2 hits each...Let's send congrats to Eric Sandurs and his beloved Stacey on their upcoming wedding - hopefully "Honey Bun" and his lovely bride will find a lifetime of love and happiness...Dan Euerle became a member of the walking wounded. Limping on the train after the game, The Url proudly showed off his multiple contusions, with  blood drying on his leg and sneezing from the dust of Diamond 5 he was a quite a mess and it was enough to make at least one young lady to recoil in horror and run out the door at the next stop. This didn't stop the Mysterious Managing General Partner from looking on with pride, disguised as a conductor, he shouted into the loud speaker: "That's my boy - What a guy!"-Hey- the next game is on 6/25 at 7:00 in the North Meadow - so be there!</p>
